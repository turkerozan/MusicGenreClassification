Me, I recently upgraded from a unlocked and jailbroken iPhone 1st gen on the T-mobile network, to a used Samsung Galaxy Vibrant, which I've modded to now have a front facing camera, rooted and is now running the Jellybean 4.2.2 update by Cyanogen 10.1, with Semaphore 2.9.9 Kernel. I came to realize, as much as I loved my iPhone when I had it, (It was a solid phone with stable software) I think I prefer Android for the fact it's open source, and much more customizable. Best part, even though I've had a smart phone for years, I have no internet service, or texting, because why when most WiFi hotspots are free and everywhere! So RAOA what do you have for your phones? You on't have to be as detailed as me :P

0	Another safety issue: aborting a landing made more risky with the runway sloping upwards.	novalidnameremains	TrueReddit	2	2	0	2012-06	1339784371	To quote the article, this situation reads much like 'Who Killed the Electric Car' in that it creates conspiracy theories out of one-sided design considerations. The FAA thinks that design is unsafe? They do have the best track record for a government organization in terms of increasing safety year over year, but it's convenient to assume a cover-up because fuel companies want more money. You don't have to be an airport designer to see the issue here either -- putting the landing runway and takeoff runway in line means that only 1 plane can land or takeoff at any given time, which is unacceptable for populated runways. Aircraft engines regularly forfeit efficiency for safety, even though airlines pay for fuel. Based on the arguments presented, it does seem like safety, construction and operation costs would outweigh the relatively small improvements. I'm glad there are people trying to rethink airports and to make them more efficient, but if you're concern is efficiency then you really just shouldn't use airports at all.

Read the documentation."" Then, if you manage to actually get a small change into the project, committing is just a pain in the ass. You go through all of this work, you test and test and test for days, then you submit and you're denied for some random reason. Then on top of that, you have your own job where you're doing essentially the same stuff, and it's exhausting to do twice the coding. Sure, I totally appreciate the people who do a lot of open source work, and I do what I can when I can, but I completely understand why people don't contribute.

If you're still in a spot where you're undervalued, or just simply underpaid, keep it up. There are opportunities out there. Side Note: I bought myself a bottle of scotch, that is old enough to buy it's own bottle of scotch. Cheers. TD"

In Germany at the moment it causes some problems because we become unreliable in organizations like NATO and the EU, but in regards to a unified European military that problem would solve itself anyway. A referendum on the use of military force would lead to too much populism and not enough expertise being considered, in my opinion.

Even now my mom struggles with the idea that you listen to and dont ask from the head white man! Interview as a female in the stem feild. Regardless of your ambitions, young females are seen as temporary, leaving soon to have children. Its not that females lacked the drive, it's that they have spent their entire lives being told that is a man's job and that no man will want you if you have a job like that and can potentially make more then him. Its a LIFETIME of being told that its your looks that Really matter, not your brain. That you ARE going to want kids and a man to take care of you. My mother, a Hispanic woman in thw south, whose culture and family woild rather she had gotten married and had sons, decided to go to college and become an engineer. Sure she married eventually, but if my dad hadnt supported her carrer/looked down on it she wouldnt have considered him. My grandpa said that the only job females should have are secretary, nurse, or teacher. Your aunt and my mother, braking free from that brainwashing is JUST as much to look up to as a female garbage collector. Even more so because of the work, training, and dedication of years it took to get there.

AMA about two years ago,my family and I went on a vacation to Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. we had taken an RV and went to an RV park right next to the ocean. when we pulled in,everyone had greeted us and were pretty friendly people. our direct neighbors were a family of four,the mom and dad plus one boy and one girl. i didn't really talk to the boy,but i did talk to the girl. at the time,i wasn't really looking for sex. i was in a relationship and i didn't want to whore around. but we did talk and we became friends quickly. when our families had gone down to the beach,me and the mini-rapist had decided to go boogie boarding. while we were boogie boarding,i was stung by a jelly fish and i immediatly passed out. i was told by my brother that i had gone under water and i got salt water in my eyes,mouth,nose,cuts,etc.. so the mini-rapist decided she was going to bring me back up to her RV to *help* me. when i woke up from my blackout,i had scratches on my chest and other parts of my body,was bleeding from my head,and was naked. i asked her what she was doing and i was told to be quiet. she immediatly started to give me head. i tried to get her off of me,but she wouldn't budge. when she finally got up,she started to rape me. while she did,she was scratching me,slapping me,and digging her nails into the newly found cut in my head. i finished inside of her and she got off. i asked her what the fuck she was doing and got in her face quickly. she had told me she couldn't resist and that since I was knocked out,it was her perfect chance. I didn't talk to her for the rest of the vacation and stayed in my locked up RV for most of the trip. sorry for this being so long. Ask Me Anything.

1	GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD!	Neon_Belly	rage	4	4	0	2012-11	1352540547	Not in America it doesn't. Being middle class here means you make too much money that you can't get food stamps, medicaid, student loans enough to cover school cost- but you don't make enough money to be able to afford any of these things by yourself. This goes for kids of middle class people as well. My parents were penny pinchers all throughout my childhood, they never got new cars, had bad healthcare, couldn't help me pay for school, and they are still paying their own student loans well into their middle ages.

I'm very grateful to ArenaNet for the game, I've really enjoyed Halloween and I was about to accept this Ascended armor, but all of you actually made me change my way of viewing this. Yes, ArenaNet has lied to us. It's not about how meaningless +x power is, it's about principle. In Lindsey Murdock's blogpost she clearly uses the terms 'gear progression' which was to be absent in GW2 and it was one of the so-called 'Golden Rules' of the game. I really don't feel like logging in anymore. Yes, I would have the time to get the new gear, but that doesn't matter. I've been lied to and that I cannot accept.

Enter Ent boyfriend (who I met through trees) :D! He has a particular friend that always gives out clean pee when friends are in need. I obtained said pee, and strapped on some belt device that another of his friends happened to have, threw in some hand warmers, and at 94 degrees, it passed the test! Here it is exactly one month after the start of my new job and I couldn't be more happy! It is the best position I've ever held, I love the people I work with, and everyone seems to comments how surprised they are at how well I'm doing right off the bat. So hopefully I'm just another statistic... helping to show that trees don't degrade my trustworthiness or skill on the job, and it doesn't make me a bad employee. p.s. - toke one up for my beautiful boyfriENT for helping me procure said pee (not directly) :D

Two things about myself I absolutely hate. First is my voice. I have a high voice, and that mixed with how I talk ( I use a lot of inflection ) I get very self conscious about my voice. Second is me being short. I am 5'6, I feel short and feel as if everyone notices it. I don't let these things affect my outward confidence, I am outgoing still and don't mind having eyes on myself ( I often will make jokes and tell stories and make people laugh ). When it comes down to it, is this stuff as big of a deal as I make it out to be, or am I blowing it out of proportion?

1	Kill the yellow bastards!	muelboy	AskReddit	1	1	0	2012-08	1345332138	"I don't think it's quite as easy as that. Take this hypothetical scenario for example: The United States, for whatever reason (coup, etc.), becomes an overt totalitarian dictatorship. Life goes on in many ways just as before, but certain segments of the population are targeted and oppressed, and freedoms, rights, and democracy become a thing of the past. China, which in recent years has become a credible democracy which by and large respects human and civil rights, leads a multinational coalition to, in their words, ""liberate us"". However, there are still vast cultural differences between us and China. In addition there are suspicions that they want access to some of our natural resources. As an American, how would you feel about this invasion?"

1	It's Okay if she's pregnant.	Snurgle	AskReddit	2	2	0	2012-03	1331058388	"Is it ever okay to end a committed relationship because your partner refuses to curtail their rapid weight gain? Let me just get one thing clear before I begin: this is not the case with my wife. She's a naturally petite woman who is often my gym partner, and I am very fortunate in that regard. The reason I'm posing this question is because I have observed (via Facebook, especially) several instances in which two people get married, and then one of them begins to rapidly gain weight shortly thereafter with no signs of trying to reverse the trend. It's the ""letting yourself go"" cliche that is often associated with marriage. Whatever that person's reasons for rapidly gaining weight after marriage are, at what point does it become a slap in the face of their partner who committed themselves to the relationship? I understand that a committed relationship (especially marriage) involves far more important factors than just looks and fitness, but what does it say about someone if they seemingly stop trying to take care of themselves once they've locked up a partner? In the instances that I've personally observed, I have no idea whether or not the concerned partner talks to the other about their weight gain and how it makes them feel. I'm a decently health-conscious person, and my wife knows that if she ever started gaining weight rapidly, I would respectfully address the subject with concern for her health and habits more-so than simply wanting her to always look her best. And she's okay with that, at least when we discuss it hypothetically. I would expect the same from her. In fact, I tend to see men ""letting themselves go"" after marriage more often than women, which is probably in part because it's more socially acceptable for men to be overweight. I don't think it should be, though. You owe it to your partner to stay healthy and try to look good for them as well. -------- I guess that's enough rambling to set up this discussion. I'll end it with a more concise phrasing of the question at hand: If your partner rapidly gains weight and/or stops caring about their appearance and refuses to address the problem over long periods of time, is it understandable to consider ending the relationship on those grounds?"

For the next two weeks, he did significantly less work at a lower quality but took every opportunity to boast about it to our manager. He would finish a call or a project and hover near his cubicle until he could strike up a conversation about the issue or client and how awesome the call went. He wasted about 15 minutes every hour, every day and was mentioned in one of our meetings as a role model of sorts. He was eventually passed up for a promotion when they opted for a professional bullshitter and he had a yelling match with the manager which ended with him walking out.

0	"Sounds like someone suffers from ""grumpy dumpies""."	MisterSquared	TalesFromRetail	8	8	0	2013-11	1384718018	"A child not to be trifled with. The scene is a movie/game rental store in the final days before their downhill slide. This particular store is a fairly busy one, but it's a weekday afternoon and the place is nearly empty. I've been ""borrowed"" from another store for the day and, having just finished my shift, am lingering while I shoot the shit with coworkers. Enter a child and his mother of non-assuming appearance and demeanor, their appearance and demeanor non-assuming enough that I forgot about them nearly immediately. Minutes pass, I putz around in indecision over which crappy movie to use my daily free rental on, and the mother/child come around to our games. Now, we primarily rented movies and games, but we did sell some as well. Invariably, the games we sold were ancient shovelware and sports games half a decade past their day; all of them were without instructions or original cases, all of them were scratched to hell. They were also all ludicrously overpriced, running damn near what a new game might. For whatever reason, the child decides he has to have some baseball game. He's been quiet so far, but he's found his muse in the form of a brightly colored plastic box with one of our generic store inserts serving as cover art, and ""Baseball 2001"" written half-assedly on it in Sharpie. ""Baseball 2001"" could be one of a couple games, but the kid wasn't concerned with quibbling details. His mother, either due to wisdom or disinterest, wasn't having any of it. The first couple polite refusals weren't taken well, and soon the kid is pulling out the arsenal. He tried to bargain, he tried to plead, and the crying didn't come long after. Hoping to soothe him, she let him carry it while they continued their rounds. This only led to him using it to smack her on the leg and continue to ramp up his growing tantrum. Her refusals became more firm as time went on and things escalated steadily. By the time he threw himself to the floor in full tantrum, the scene had garnered the attention of my coworkers and I. It was nothing alarming, and there was an almost refreshing quality to the mother not breaking down in the face of a crying kid. When his tantrum began, she earned a bit more of our respect by taking the game from him and stating very clearly: ""I'm not buying you this game today. We can talk to your father tonight - but if you keep this up, I'm going to write down the game's name and tell him about it so neither of us EVER buys it for you for your WHOLE LIFE."" My coworkers and I all had a look I can best describe as that Obama ""Not Bad"" face as we nodded to each other, assuming the matter was closed. Not so. The child, face red and tear-streaked, stopped making much noise. This wasn't because he was soothed or stopped, but because he'd turned into a white-hot ball of seething rage, his senses failing as his world collapsed around him. He started making noise, eventually, in an unconscious sort of way. It was this half-asthmatic, cat-in-heat, moaning sort of sound that belonged in a Lovecraft novel. It never got very loud, but his actions spoke volumes. Promptly, he dropped his pants and took a splashing, chunky, yellow shit all over the floor. My curiosity about how this would end collided with my minimum-wage survival instinct, and I got the hell out of Dodge in short order. I'm told she cleaned it up, in tears, while the child went back to asking if he could have the game. Ta-da!"

When I said yes, all of their faces, from six to fourteen, lit up, and the next two hours were a noisy, excited discussion about the merits of each doctor and which episodes were the best, etc. I was absolutely shocked and delighted that as a 22 year old I could talk to these kids and we could share such a burning passion for such an incredible show, and I am so glad that this generation has something to bond us together so strongly.

Hey Gunnit, had a weird thing happen to me this past weekend that I'm hoping someone out there can explain. I was shooting my Yugo SKS and was getting frequent FTF with light-strikes on the primers. Maybe one of out every ten rounds would do this. Then, on the last round in the magazine, I had a hang fire. It was just a fraction of a fraction of second delay, but enough that I took notice. A cloud of smoke poured out of the receiver, and I saw that a small shard of metal, presumably part of the case, had been wedged into the firing pin hole, blocking the pin. Needless to say, I was pretty shook up. I went home, soaked the bolt over night in Liquid Wrench, and disassembled it and gave it a good cleaning. Any idea what might have happened? And yes, I'm aware of the SKS's risk of slam firing, and no I don't have one of Murray's SKS firing pins. Thanks in advance!

Problem now is every time we jerk the gherkin, we end up with a lot of unwanted, sticky white stuff everywhere, right? Right. So, first order of business: no more socks. They're expensive... gumming up the works, plumbing-wise. Now you might be thinking to yourself, 'But Uncle Andy, what do I do with all that pearl jam if I can't spew it into Mr. Sock?' Glad you asked. You can have a lovely time tuggin' the tiger in the shower each morning. That eliminates the need for a goo glove. But the day is long, masturbation's fun... so unless we wanna take four or five showers every day, we're gonna need some other options here. So let's start with the basics. Tissues: perfectly acceptable backstop for all that Creamy Italian. They can be rough and dry on such soft, sensitive skin, not to mention they can stick to your dick head like a fuckin' Band-Aid. Ouch. From there we move on to more lubricated flak-catchers. Specifically bananas. Step one, peel the banana. Step two, slip the peel over your Randy Johnson and start pitching. Now for extra credit, warm up the peel in the microwave - not TOO hot... serious yowza. Also olive oil, moisturizer, honey, spit, butter, hair conditioner and Vaseline can all be used for lube. In my opinion the best lube... is lube. So save your allowance... invest in some soon. All right, moving on... when you tug your Thomas on the toilet, shoot right into the bowl. In bed, soft t-shirt, perhaps a downy hand towel of your very own that you don't mind tossing after tossing. There's no such thing as polishing the Raised Sceptre of Love too much. It reduces stress, it enhances immune function... also, practice makes perfect. So work on your control now while you're a solo artist, you'll be playing some long, happy duets in the future. All right, class dismissed.

You simply dump a bucket of water into the bowl after you're finished using it, but not so fast that it overflows. You could also add the water to the upper tank and use it the normal way, but it's not necessary. I thought this was well-known, but I've told lots of people that didn't know it works. It's helpful when the water is shut off for any reason. As long as the toilet is connected to a drain, this will work. I've used it when really needing to go in an unfinished house, and when the power went out in a house that had an electric well pump.

Mnementh2230	atheism	2	2	0	2012-01	1325857316	"Liberation My entire life I have grown up in a very religious family. I never had any question about the existence of god because I considered it as fact. I didn't even know there was such thing as an atheist until I was in high-school. I just assumed that atheists were mistaken and would one day see the error of their ways. I had always prided myself on my ability to use logic and think rationally. This sparked the question that I one day asked my teacher (in a religious private school). ""How do we know that our religion is the right one?"" I was given a quick answer that didn't make much sense and the subject was changed. I began to do some serious research into science and atheism. I began to realize that all of my pre-concieved notions about the way the world worked were wrong. I still believed in god of course but I felt that it was him creating the science to better understand our surroundings. It was at about this time that I discovered r/atheism. I read and read and read. I started becoming unable to sleep or eat. It was hard to believe in god with all of this evidence contrary to his existence. One day I woke up in the morning and I said to myself ""I am an atheist"". I had never felt so free in my life. It was like an enourmous weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I am still unable to admit this to my friends and family but I feel fine admitting it here where I can be proud of having come to this conclusion on my own. I want to thank everyone that is a member of r/atheism for helping me through this and teaching me not to believe something based off of nothing. Thank you all so much."

Drugs like cocaine and heroin are usually smuggled in, just the way guns could be smuggled in if there were a ban. You could say meth is produced using legal products, which when obtained by users, are in an illegal form. It's same way guns are legal products, and when obtained by criminals (usually through theft or purchasing stolen items) they are illegal. People who want to do bad things will find a way to do bad things. We have Mexico as a bordering country. We have so much border area, that we'll never be able to patrol it all. You must remove the reasons people want to do bad things. Why is it guns are legal in many other countries, but people don't kill each other in those countries? It's the same reason they have violent video games in othr countries, and people don't kill each other in those countries. It's the same reason other countries don't have religions, and those people DONT. FUCKING. KILL. EACH. OTHER. Maybe, just maybe, it isn't a drug problem, or a gun problem, or a lack of faith problem, or a violent video game problem, or a communist problem, or a socialist problem. Maybe it's an ""America is an uneducated pit of despair, poverty, corporate influence, oppression by the wealthy, disease (because of lack of healthcare), and cognitive dissonance about some fairytale guy that controls everything in the universe, so I'm not accountable for anything I do on my own, because Jesus...

All of this of course, happened after you pretended one of your clients was your GF for 3 months, because you didn't have a GF at the time. You live in a sitcom or something?

Ditto for Rakdos Augermage, Voidmage Prodigy, Ranger of Eos, Meddling Mage, Rootwater Thief, Avalanche Riders, Sylvan Safekeeper, etc - they're just called by their names.

The only other I can think of that uses a similar style with words and the sounds they make is Earl Sweatshirt. They both use a similar method of delivery that is appealing to my ear while at the same time either funny or clever. Lil' Wayne isn't that clever obviously and it shows through his music in general."

Now you'll have to put things away before sleeping. I would always get home from a trip and just leave my suitcase partially unpacked laying on the floor. I discovered something that always forces me to unpack faster. I first dump the entire contents of the suitcase onto my bed. Now *at least* my suitcase is empty and I can put that away. Second, in order to sleep that night I have to clear off the contents of my bed. And since it is all spread out (rather than trapped in the half-open suitcase) I can make faster progress at putting everything away.

Properly tightened cuffs restrain that kind of mobility - you can move your arms to the side, you can even tilt to one side to scratch yourself if you want - but you can't get to the back of your head. Nor could you turn your hands to operate a pistol at the angle needed to shoot yourself in the back of your head (unless you have the maddest double joints since Dominik Hasek). I'd rather not think a cop executed this kid, but there's not really a way he could have done it himself.

Biffingston	conspiratard	5	5	0	2013-08	1377654317	When you only look at the big picture and see the major players it sure looks like the start of a World War. On one side we have the US, a country that for the last decade has fought conflict over conflict some of which were considered mistakes. On the other side we have Russia, fresh off it's economic downturn after the political powerhouse Putin stepped in and cast out the plutocrats. On Russia's side we also have China, an up and coming economic force who many say envy the US as the dominant world power and wish to overthrow it. Their battleground at the moment is the small country of Syria, wracked with civil war both sides have supported opposing groups and are fighting for them in the UN. After the UN has been unable to agree on measures to take, mostly due to Russian and Chinese veto powers the US has made a bold claim that Syrian leaders have deployed chemical weapons against their own people and threatens yet another conflict. Russia and China stand adamant that more time is needed to get all the facts while the US seems only to want to get involved in conflict after conflict in the middle east. All the set pieces are here for the start of the next great conflict of our age. When you look at the small picture it's just political posturing over a piece of war torn desert and the US trying to act tough so Iran doesn't get any funny ideas. Russia and China know this so they take the opposing side and veto any extreme measures in the UN and the world keeps turning.

On the most recent one, the mother of the bride was utterly insane and we had a couple small things that we noticed right away were going to go ""wrong"" (they were fine, but the mother of the bride was going to go insane because it wasn't the way she wanted it). So we grabbed the event manager and asked them if we could, with their assistance, put the blame on one random staffer. So he called in a staffer on their day off, we paid her $300 in cash, and the mother of the bride chewed her out for a couple minutes while we look disappointed and then the mother of the bride ""fired"" her from the event staffer company (*which is just really funny to me that the mother of the bride actually thought she had the ability to unquestionably fire someone from a career at somewhere else and it would be totally accepted*). The girl was in on it the whole time and said that if she could get paid for entire day of work plus $300 for 45 minutes of work (including driving to the location), she would love it. The rest of the time the mother of the bride would find things wrong and then say ""Well, this must have been that girl's doing. I am glad I fired her because she was worthless"" and we all just said ""definitely, great decision"". Made the day so much easier. I really wish this was my idea, but it was the father of the bride's idea. I can only assume he has done this in the past."

Usually not as fiery, but these rivalries usually have history behind them and a good story. For my Chiefs, I think when we play the Steelers or Colts in the regular season it's no big deal, but in the postseason they give me anxiety thanks to so many crushed playoff hopes. The Colts especially, and particularly if it's at Arrowhead and cold, no thanks to... he who shall not be named. I also like Chiefs-Packers matchups because of the history of the AFL-NFL merger and Super Bowl I. It made that game a couple years ago a little extra emotion. Nothing but respect there though.

Pure_Adamic	latterdaysaints	2	2	0	2013-07	1375287263	"I have had some of the best gospel discussions recently with my Muslim coworker...its funny but I really believe we have more in common with Muslims than we do other Christians. Some that come to mind are: * New book of revealed scripture due to the bible's corruption over the years * Solid belief in Prophets and the necessity of them * Very similar beliefs as far as health codes go He has a huge amount of respect for the fact that on average we seem to actually live our religion instead of just claim ""we believe"" and then do whatever we want. He has found on average Mormons give him much more intelligent answers when asked questions about the bible. He has also read the Book of Mormon and finds it very interesting. Anyways sorry to go off on a tangent I just thought I would share some of this while we are on the topic of the Qur'an :)"

After reaching Diamond, I kinda stopped playing ranked as much. That's not what this post is about though. I love League and I'll probably keep playing until the servers go down. I'm just saying I've played several years of this game (and the original dota as well) and I know my way around it. About 5 minutes ago I was watching Imaqtpie's stream and I saw a destroyed tower and it suddenly hit me. Why can't we rebuild the inhib towers? I'd imagine the system for it would be pretty simple. Similar to a surrender vote, a player picks a downed tower and a vote goes out to the other 4 teammates to spend, say, 500 gold each. If each person says yes, that tower is brought back. I haven't thought it out so much, so maybe it's a bad idea. And I'm sure it's not the first time it's been brought up. But the second it hit me it occurred to me to be a good idea. It creates more opportunity for comebacks while not being so frustrating for the winning team.

Skoldir is probably the strongest early game naut, but to do well you need to be able to land his 3 punch combo and his toss ability which are short range and different from almost all the other nauts in the game. Get the timing and ranges down and you should be able to throw enemies into your turrets then beat them down for fast kills and steamroll your way to a win. He combos very well with other crowd control abilities like Froggy stun, Derpl snare, Lonestar bull, or zone abilities like Gnaw's weedlings and Yuri's mines. Either drop down onto your enemies from above or follow up a teammates stun and toss your enemies to their doom.

Yes, the US has libertarians, but they are often dogmatic and deontological, rather than utilitarian as European liberals tend to be - for example, a libertarian would not support a carbon tax, but a liberal would. Why does nothing similar to this exist in America?

Four months ago my eyes started to have a film over them when I blinked. I would blink again and the film would go away for a few minutes, then it would come back again. It did this for a few weeks. I saw an optomatrist and she said I should see an opthamologist, so I did. He said it was dry eyes and gave me restasis and told me it takes two months for it to work. It hasn't worked. I saw another eye doc and he said that I had an infection and gave me azasite, augmentin and cephalexin. Finally the film went away, but now, my right eye is completely blurred. There is no pain, redness, swelling or pus, just blurryness. Also, the film came back once the antibiotics left my system. Does anyone know what the hell it could be? I had blood work done and everything was fine, the eye doc said my eye was physically healthy as far as he could tell, which is what bothers me, because why the hell is it blurry? I mean I don't need new glasses because the ones I have now were fine and basically overnight, my eye just got blurry. I can't see clearly close up or far away out of my right eye, but my left eye is, thankfully, fine now. So I have one good eye for now. Any ideas at all are appreciated. Thanks. I'm only thirty five and can't picture myself living like this for the rest of my days.

I wanted to move somewhere new and exciting, he wanted to stay in Utah. I wanted to travel and be an artist and yadda yadda, he wanted to be a lawyer and build a nice home and have a family. He is a year older than myself, and he didn't want to uproot his life after my graduation from HS and move with me. So... we broke up. I married someone else about 3 years later, after HS sweetheart and I had lost touch. It was awful and the marriage fell apart and I came back to Utah, and our hometown, after that. I left most of my life behind with my ex, and moved into my mom's basement again. I had clothes, my books, and a few small personal items (a stuffed animal, some photos, a snowglobe) and nothing else when I came back. Strangely, I returned home with about as much ""stuff"" as I'd left with at 18, with nothing to show for the past 5 years. So I bummed around the town for awhile, broken hearted (and broke), holding down stupid, minimum wage jobs and not really caring anymore about anything. Then one day, my dad, tired of watching me be miserable, handed me $100 and told me to go do something fun that day. So, I started my forced-upon-me-fun-day with a stop to the coffee shop for a stupidly overpriced latte, and, well, there he was. My friends all tell me it's like a bad Lifetime movie, and it really, really is... Only, I'm enjoying the hell out of it. :D"

It was decided best not to tell her just yet, but she came up to me and hugged me affectionately as she often does, and said: ""Oh thank god it's you! I don't know whether to love you or kill you!"" and she tittered as she often did to me, and for some reason this broke the boundary for me between playing a long with a fantasy, and being cruel not telling her what had happened. So whilst she held me as lovingly as she could in her arms I explained the whole situation to her. It was a very sad moment for me, and devastating and bewildering to her. She let go and thanked me and walked away."

I don't think the first order of business should be to lash out at him or go above his head to the deans or whatever. See how he responds.

I used to play great games like Harvest Moon 64, Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Age of Empires, Shogun Total War, Prince of Persia, Ninja Gaiden, Diablo 2, Descent, Starcraft, etc. I would get really into a game, and wanted nothing more all day than to play that game. These days, I hardly get excited for a new title that I should be wetting myself over, and if I muster up the excitement, I am generally not as thrilled with a game as I wish I were. Or I just start up the game and don't feel like playing. I understand that this is expected with age, but I downloaded an N64 emulator on my phone last night and I was almost in tears just thinking about how much joy these games used to bring. My request is simple: Recommend to me any PC game that you think will bring me out of this slump.

One of the full-timers stayed with me and had me walk him through the process for the first computer (I have no previous job experience in this field, so they were understandably cautious). 100 gigabytes, pulled off an old but still functional drive. Easy as it gets. After windows reported it's success, I open up the user file on the new computer to double check. Contacts: empty. Desktop: empty. Downloads: empty. Documents, music, pictures- all empty. Finally, I reach ""my videos"". Sure enough, just short of 100 gigs in that file. All of it porn. I turned to the tech supervising me.

We've seen so much nonsense pool up, especially towards the end of this season over people cheating or cutting corners to get to a certain elo. We've seen ELO boosts, people rigging ranked games, forcing drops, all for the purpose of getting higher ratings. Perhaps the reward system needs to be reconsidered for next season, perhaps charing PFE price (3250 RP) for the skin 1500+ elo players receive for free. Yes, it won't be exclusive to you gold+ players, but it already isn't, as people are paying ridiculous amounts of money to have high elo players get them to that 1500+ rating. This not only devalues the badge and profile banner you receive for your rating, but creates a toxic environment for players trying to raise their elo whilst playing against people giving elo jobs. Honestly, if Riot gave the War Hero Janna skin to 1500+ elo players for free and charged $25 for all the other players, we probably wouldn't see the elo boosting and game rigging we are right now. Also, those players 1500+ still will recieve banners and badges to tout their previous ratings to the world. Thoughts?

It is not, by any means, unusual for people with mental health problems to have good periods and bad. If someone who was in a good period but knew that they may not always be had the option to take some precautions for the sake of themselves and others, they make the right choice. This wouldn't in any way restrict gun purchases or ownership from anyone other than those who wish to self-restrict.

But not so much anymore. To wit, Steve Swenson, who is one of the top alpinists in the world (just got the Piolet D'Or and is the current President of the American Alpine Club) sport climbs often. Now it's just another type of climbing. There are still conversations about bolting ethics, especially bolting routes that can be protected with gear (cams/nuts/etc). But nobody really trashes the idea of sport climbing anymore. I think we've really moved into the age of defining folks as climbers, then what kind of climber they prefer to do. For example, I climb, and prefer long trad multipitch. But shoot - I'm in for sport on a shorter day, or with groups."

What happens? the program bogs down and starts to run like shit usually until it crashes or becomes unresponsive. Not to mention Rocksteady went batshit (no pun intended) with the Physx library. Haven't you noticed all the little papers and leaves blowing around? Each one of those assets has physics applied and is being calculated by your GPU. Doesn't sound like much right? Well multiply it a few times and it starts to become expensive. If you can get an older card throw it in your system and dedicate it to just physx this will lighten the load. Or get another 560 and run it in SLi you will start to see a huge difference. And if you can't run it at max? So what! dial it down a little till it's enjoyable.

I was on the side of 107th ave between Groat Road and 124th street and they didn't even half change lanes to pass. They hit my rear view mirror and were just about and inch away from my handlebar. As far as hands free vs in your hand for a call, I cant see much of an impairment difference. Whenever I'm in a car with friends I don't feel right talking to them because they should be focusing on the road. Studies have apparently said that talking with someone beside you is safer than on the phone because they can see things for you and alert you, but that was just the conclusion of the study, I didn't get a chance to read into it.

0	TL;DR Do the opposite of what is expected by the players.	spgarbet	boardgames	10	10	0	2013-11	1384739558	"I've done some computer simulations for the game and so have other people. There's no mathematically ""correct"" play in this situation, but it strongly depends on what the resistance expects. If the resistance expects spies to fail the 2-player missions, then not failing the mission gives you a lot of credibility as a member of the resistance. You can use that credibility to pass off other players as being the spies. If the resistance expects spies to pass the first mission no matter what, then you don't get any advantage by passing. Players will still be equally wary of you, and you have not gained much credibility. You bag a failed mission for the spies, but you can't reveal yourself after just one mission. You have to convince the table that the other guy is the spy, or at least convince the table that it's a 50/50 in order for it to be a good play. You're best off going 1v1 against someone with a reputation for being an aggressive spy, or in a game where nobody thinks the spies will fail the first mission, or a game where you're not the mission lead."

One of the companies I call on hired a new Storage Administrator (28yrs, Male, SO &lt;1yr). After a couple interactions, he came on to me. I blew it off but somehow it stuck with me. I made it clear that I was married, have been faithful&amp; plan to remain that way. In short he is a notorious cheater. He is very attractive. (Fuck it he is so hot the thought of him inside me makes me dripping wet.) He is a Dick. The total opposite of what I like in a lover. The Good Part Despite my good intentions my body took over. 1st encounter: Meeting to discuss our contract renewal and it lead into my legs on his lap while he sat in his chair. As I sat in a chair across him in my dress, His hands on my feet was such a turn-on, for me &amp; him. His hands ran up my thighs grabbing my ass &amp; pulling my legs around him. His thick dick chubby was warm against me. I tried not to stare into his eyes. In my head I started to think ""Pretty Woman"" (no kissing). His plump lips were so seductive. They were so soft and his tongue as it slid across mine, wow. I just melted imaging his tongue on my clit. The encounter neared the end as I went to leave I said I feel cheated. He replied, "" if you want to see it you will have to pull it out yourself."" I love a challenge. I fumbled around with his belt in excitement, like a 15 yr old girl about to see her first penis. As his slightly chubby cock filled my hand &amp; our eyes went to the office door , which was not locked, I realized I was in trouble. We stood interlocking lips as I stroked his dick &amp; his finger thrust into my wet pussy. I moaned ever so quietly as our interaction ended. 2nd encounter: We met outside of a Data storage plex where his buddy had a box truck parked. The door closed nearly but a glow from the street lights eliminated our bodies. A comforter thrown on the flat board floor. We sat on the comforter talking about various topics as he kissed my toes (hot right!). His hands rubbing my calf as he made his way up my thighs, then to his surprise my panty-less pussy. On his knees in front of me, he bowed in submission as he ran his tongue across my clit and in and out of my wet pussy. He laid on top of me as we kissed passionately. I rolled him over on to his back and kissed him along his neck making my way down his body biting him softly as I made my way down to the thick dick I had been fantasizing about since our last meeting. I exhaled my warm wet breath on the tip of his porno sized perfect cock. The excitement &amp; anticipation in his eyes as I licked his dick sliding the shaft along my lips. I filled my mouth with his balls then began to lick his taint. I tried to control my excitement because I longed to suck his dick for the days leading up to our ronde view. I however know the excitement is in the tease so I held off on allowing his dick to protrude into my mouth. He took charge forcing me on all fours as he licked my pussy from behind. He pulled me up on my knees my back against his chest. We kissed as I played with my pussy and sliding his hard cock between my legs. My wet pussy made his thrusting me from behind along the exterior of my pussy feel ""orgasmic"". It was all either of is could do not to just force it inside giving into our deepest desires. We shared in conversation to slow things down. To my surprise I found myself beginning to really like him. Not just because he is hot and I want to fuck his brains out instead because of the things he hides from others. I like he is a cheater and I could never worry about being with him in a relationship, I like that he is a dork deep inside, he is sweet no matter how much he denies himself to be. I found a new desire. Back to the good stuff. This box truck meeting lasted nearly 3 hrs. In that time we 69-d , which was amazing. We switched it up with me topless and naked atop him while he laid on his back. The juice from my wet pussy dripped onto him as he kissed my perfect breast. My pussy twitched with anticipation as he realized he set the alarm for AM instead of PM. We rushed to find our clothes and dress for our return to reality. Having shared this box truck fantasy has sparked a part of me that I thought was dead. TL:DR - I'm married, fooled around but I don't want to stop now. I fucked up."

Now typically leading in completion percentage is accomplished by lots of short safe passes, but Aaron Rodgers is also leading in yard per attempt with 9.9. He is not only completing the most passes, but they are going for the most yards, which is just absolutely crazy.

Warning: Slight wall of text ahead. ^read ^it ^you ^know ^you ^want ^to **Back story** I went to a large high school and we had security guards. Well I used to hang out with all the punks, skaters, metal heads and goth kids. We would all hang out together in between classes and on our lunch breaks. Well there was one jackass security guard, we'll call him Jim, that would harass us constantly. Every single time he would come near our group he would nitpick the finest detail to get the entire group thrown in detention. One lunch break we were all outside and two people were practicing on their guitars for class. He walked by and saw the guitars came over and confiscated both of them and told us all that we were disrupting classrooms. He lead us to office and on the way we passed a group of kids on their lunch break screaming and playing their guitars in the middle of a hallway surrounded by classrooms. As we walked by I asked Jim why we were in trouble, he looked over at the other kids in their letter jackets and told us to just keep walking. Shit like this occurred every day. By my senior year I was on a first name basis with our disciplinary principal and all the security guards. I was so happy to be rid of this douche once I graduated. He was even at the ceremony. **THE REVENGE** Fast forward to roughly halfway through the next school year. My sister forgets her glasses at home and calls me to bring them up to the school. Every guest has to check in at the attendance office and conveniently enough she would be in that exact room that period as she was a student aide for the attendance office. I walk into the building and head to the room. I get inside and hand my sister her glasses and chat for a second with some of the people inside. I leave and promptly walk towards the front door. As I walk down the hall Jim comes out of the security office and stares at me. I keep walking and smile knowing that I don't have to take his shit anymore. As he passes he stops and yells out to me. He wants me to show him a hall pass. I keep a straight face and tell that I don't go to school there. He demands my student ID and I smile and repeat to him that I have graduated and that I'm going home. He actually escorts me into the security office and sets me down at his desk and tries to give me detention. I just sat there and watched him the whole time. Any time he would ask where I was going or why I wasn't in class I would just tell him that I had graduated. He refused to believe me and insisted on giving me detention. After sitting calmly at his desk for roughly a half hour a few more of the security guards came back to the office along with my Disciplinary Principal. They look over at me start to ask what's going on. I turn around and tell them Jim is trying to give me detention. They all start laughing at him. He starts to get flustered by the mocking. Eventually the Disciplinary Principal went into his office and came back with a piece of paper. He looks down at it looks back at me. And then gets up and leaves. I chat with the other guards and the disciplinary principal for a few moments until Jim comes back.

Also, having him wash your hair is one of the best things in the world. When you've had a rough day and you need a hug, it's super convenient to have him there. Agree with the beard trimmings all. over. You will occasionally need to go through his undie drawer and throw things away. Don't tell him you're doing it, because he'll get mad you're tossing that maroon pair of boxers he's had for twelve years and wore on his first day of high school. Men keep their undies until you can see right through them and there are more holes than you've ever seen. That cleaning 'schedule' you outlined when you first moved in together? He'll still need reminders. Set a particular day for each chore and you won't have as many problems. Absolutely nothing compares to snuggling up to the man you love every night. After an argument where you've still gone to bed miffed, he'll still cuddle up to you when he's sleeping. And it'll probably get me all misty eyed every time.

The reason we can't inbreed now is because we have acquired lots of mutations or ""junk"" in our DNA, and if the genes are too similar and contain the same mutations, complications happen. Their genes didn't have mutations, so they could have kids fine. See what I'm saying?"

Apparently if you're not a pro player you must lane CM and can't build midas, or you're a tryhard or 'noob copying what they saw in pro games' It seems like the very best way to play the hero to secure an early lead provided you have a hero that can solo a sidelane and no other jungler. She benefits so much from a fast lvl 3 boots and smoke, team benefits from fast point in aura at lvl 2, and she can easily secure a win for mid and/or safe for your team during first night, not to mention every decent solo offlane hero LOVES an early 1-2 points in her aura. Midas is pretty much core because she doesn't need to buy mana items, doesn't really lend to a fast push gg lineup, redresses the exp loss from roaming, and accelerates gold for blink dagger/force staff, and probably bkb. What other better way is there to play the hero?

It's probably a bigger deal in your mind than it needs to be. My little brother had similar issues and went to overnight camps all the time when he was a kid. - I would recommend compression shorts or briefs to wear over the diaper so it won't be too noticeable under your pjs. Maybe find some sort of swishy material to mask the noise? - Keep the diapers, wipes, etc. in the bottom of your bag in the bottom of your bag and change in the bathroom before bed. Keep it under the sink so if you have an accident and wake up at night to change yourself, they won't question why you are bringing your bag in. - I think the other poster was right about putting the used diapers in a sealed bag in the morning when you're showering. Maybe you can go down to the lobby early in the morning and throw them away in the public bathrooms? Good luck sweetie!

0	Is there also a study that explains why these kids tend to be fat?	johnsom3	AskReddit	1	1	0	2013-10	1383030940	There's actually been a *ton* of study on this. There's a rather strong correlation between these kind of kids who lie a lot and kids who come from dysfunctional families and broken homes. For one, kids from dysfunctional families often see a lot more dishonesty. Sometimes it's one spouse lying to another about fidelity, lying to creditors about payments, shirking responsibility but feigning effort, whatever. Even though kids might not be able to comprehend it's a lie, they learn about the concept of lying, and how sometimes people say things, and someone doesn't believe that. And so they try it out. They'll lie about something to get out of trouble at home. They'll lie, as suggested, for attention that they may otherwise be neglected of. The biggest lies they'll start to tell are that their family is normal. They don't want to be ostracized for being the weird kid from the weird family, so they filter everything about their home life. Eventually, lying just feels more normal. From there, kids start to lie just because it's what they do. They'll lie even if it doesn't confer any sort of benefit or advantage, whether the truth is more interesting than their bullshit. Living in your little world of half-truths and outright lies helps you cope because part of you gets to inhabit that imaginary world. Lying becomes escapism.

It starts at birth when they are quickly put into daycare instead of staying at home with Dad, Mom, or a grandparent. They will be forced into an education system that will teach outdated skills. Then they will go into debt for college so they can have a chance at a job. Not a great job, just one to get by. They will live with less income, smaller homes, more debt, less social services, and higher taxes. Big deal if they are spoiled now. They have a hard life ahead of them.

If that local blowback extended to the kind of car bombs or IEDs directed at the occupation in Afghanistan and formerly in Iraq, then the politicians would be forced to consider their actions in a more realistic manner. However, the electronic eavesdropping is much more effective within the USA so that this tends to get caught earlier, and is often fabricated by the ""intelligence"" services themselves in order to maintain the internal wars on freedom. So while there is minor blowback occurring internally, it is not on a level significant enough to cause politicians any real concern."

Decreasing the length of a mission? There has been a lot of discussion here about the change in missionary age eligibility requirements. Most of us here tend to agree that this occurred for a few potential reasons... * The number of missionaries has been decreasing * Missionaries who get to spend time in the real world are less likely to go, catching them before that time will prevent some losses. My question is, what is the next step? These are only temporizing measures. In a few years the numbers will taper off again. The effects of the internet will continue to chip away at the youth. Do you think that the church will eventually decrease mission length to 18 months for the men, and a year for the sisters (maybe the men too)? Then maybe they'll get people who are on the fence and not ready to commit 2 years but figure that 1 year isn't that long. I can see this happening in a few years.

0	So God hates sin, but only enough to punish it, not enough to prevent it?	invisime	Christianity	1	1	0	2012-01	1327072572	Well, one position is that there are two wills of God. God has a sovereign/permissive (depends on denomination and beliefs of your sister's church) will in which God decrees/allows everything to happen in order that in the end, although it might not appear so now, all things will work together for His good. God also hates sin, however. And although this part of him does have influence, it does not overpower his other will. Although he might not enjoy having people rebel against him, in the end he knows that it will work out best if they do.

0	Slightly salty, sour, but a pleasant crunchy texture.	Chilly73	TalesFromRetail	7	7	0	2013-07	1373956232	"Expert level shoplifting I used to work as a bag boy/cart pusher for a large chain grocery store, and we'd get shoplifted from all the time. Mostly teenagers stealing bottles of liquor, and most of the time they'd get away with it. Once in a while people would attempt a bigger heist with a cart full of groceries, but those were rare. My favorite story about shoplifting happened one Friday night at work. It was pretty slow in the store and I was outside on my 15 minute break shooting the shit with a coworker. We're standing out in front of the entrance when we see two girls, probably in the 18-20 age range, hustling from the store with a couple bottles of liquor. Usually when this happens they are heading to a car to drive off immediately. Not these geniuses. They get into a car, in plain sight of me and my coworker, and sit in the backseat presumably waiting for one of their accomplices to return from god knows where. My manager comes strolling out about 30 seconds after them and says, not expecting us to be of any help, ""Hey, did you see where those girls went? They stole some alcohol."" My coworker and I shrug and point at the car they are sitting in, about 40 feet away from us. My manager gives us a look like ""Seriously?"" and walks over to the car. We watch the scene from a distance: he knocks on the window, berates them for a minute, snatches the bottles back and tells them never to come back to the store. The girls are bawling. My manager walks back into the store muttering ""dumbasses"" under his breath. It was hilarious."

Many people have a habit of not following their messages though to the end. You know, when people expect you to fill in their missing conclusion... It is a sign of either social cowardice or just stupid social tactics. I always feel a need to ask them what exactly they expect me to fill in there, like I would put in the self critique or whatever. If you got a point to make then do it, not leave it hanging like a rag... So I think a corrective bot is in-order. The message should be properly pedantic and the bot be unleashed on the popular bitching subreddits.

I believe the average drive time is about half that of America due to higher population density and smaller regions. When you barely ever drive on a highway, driving a car that would shatter into a fine mist at 80 miles per hour isn't a problem. Sturdier car means worse gas mileage most of the time. It takes a *lot* of safeguards to have the slightest chance of surviving a collision at highway speeds, and most of those safeguards amount to what is essentially armor plating.

This is literally an example of the federal government via decades of expanding powers infecting every aspect of the economy, our personal lives and the lives of people in other countries. Its a thug slashing the tires on your car so you cant go to work to remind you to pay your protection money. Our dear leaders on both sides of the aisle continue to vote themselves more power and interfere with our lives more and more. We have children in Congress playing with billion dollar toys that have the ability to ruin everyone's lives. But just like you don't give a 2 year old a loaded gun to play with during a temper tantrum, we should be taking away the powers our federal government uses to fuck our lives over. So the next time this happens we can put the children in a corner and go on like nothing has happened. Our dear leaders in Congress will always be the petulant children and anyone who trusts them with anything beyond the weakest of powers is a fool.

Therefore McD's needs to compensate with advertising, and Chipotle is a widely recognized top-notch joint. Although even with that being said, I think McD's wastes all its time and money on advertising. Has a McDonald's commercial ever made you change your mind about a meal you were going to have, in order to go to McDonald's?? No. They are pointless.

0	| the pope will declare that this person must now be in heaven I'm curious here, does the pope have the power to decide who goes to heaven or is he like a prophet and knows who goes to heaven?	WalterFromWaco	DebateAChristian	1	1	0	2012-07	1342038158	I'm Lutheran as well, but a saint in the catholic church is a person who is deemed to be in heaven. Catholics believe that people must spend time in purgatory to atone for sins that haven't been absolved for before death. A saint is a person whose life has been so virtuous that their time in purgatory is short. After several miracles attributed to them, and a few other requirements, the pope will declare that this person must now be in heaven. Catholics pray for the saints to make intercession on their behalf to God. Certain saints have particular interests. St. Anthony might be the patron saint for lost causes, while St. Patrick would be the patron saint of the Irish. An Irishman looking for something lost would have options. But saints are saints, though, because they were faithful to God. They aren't gods themselves. They are agents of god, just like angels and some of us mere mortals.

The stadium in Brasilia is being demolished and rebuilt. The other 5 are being upgraded.

0	Abstain from marriage or sex if married?	maroon_and_white	Christianity	1	1	0	2013-04	1365090936	"No, procreation is one obvious ""purpose"" of sex (biologically) but it is not the only purpose. Old married couples are welcome to go crazy as well. Ultimately I don't believe in dualism or a complete separation of body and soul. What you do with your body affects you spiritually. Sex is meant to be good spiritually and bring a couple closer together (and feel awesome) but it can also be sinful when done wrongly. Edit - and yes, if unmarried, barren women should abstain as well."

1	Wow... I didn't know SC2 warped my view of reality.	ByronicAsian	NoFap	1	1	0	2013-06	1372003706	NoFap and Videogames part II So earlier I made a post about NoFap combined with gaming and I've made a very interesting discovery. After playing a substantial amount of mass effect 2 last night and over the last few days (4-5) hours, I discovered that I was starting to feel exactly how I felt when I was fapping. All I wanted to do was play Mass Effect. My energy went down, I didn't sleep as well each night. Not only that, but it made my NoFap journey harder because it was constantly causing me to get urges to fap. Conclusion: Don't play videogames. The porn industry and the game industry are dangerous. While porn is purely evil and in my opinion should never be watched, video games are okay once in a while as long as you play once or twice a week a few days apart for no more than one hour. Porn is destructive to the mind and causes you to objectify women and distorts your view of how things are. Videogames also alter your view of reality. Both are like drugs in that sense!

The movie you liked is still there, exactly the same whether they never made an English version or if they make 40 sequels. How can any of those ruin the original?

We met once a month and set goals for ourselves, and held each other accountable (in a nice, supportive way), and shared information about the industry. And we did it for free over shared cheese and crackers and wine. It was awesome. I did a ton on my career. I'm trying to start something up where I am now. You should do the same. If you know other actors you think are cool, invite them to commit to coming over to your house once a month to set goals for your careers. You'd be surprised how just having that once a month deadline helps you get more done. And you can get advice from people about next steps to take in your career, or ask them what they think about your monologue, etc. And again, there can be cheese and crackers involved. Ha ha.

1	"Totally all the fault of ""the rich"" and not over regulation and a broke ass banking system both of which encourage consolidation over new growth"	NickRausch	politics	-10	-10	0	2013-04	1365913532	Here is a serious economic issue that isn't often even discussed: We have an upward flow in currency. Over time, money leaves the less wealthy and heads to the more wealthy. Things like minimum wage and high taxes on the rich are supposed to push the money back down. A lot of arguments can be made about interfering in the market and and the Laffer Curve (which I don't think we've reached the apex of, but that's another argument of) and such and they're appropriate arguments. Classical economics, though imperfect, got us where we are now. However, that doesn't address the fact that the issue remains: Less and less money is available to the average person and more and more actual currency is being replaced with credit. Despite the claim that business owners and such will reinvest their money and what not, that's not happening nearly as fast as it needs to. Plus, a lot of money made by the wealthy is through corporate investment. Myriad people who don't actually have any businesses to grow make money from businesses! Further, those people, being individuals who experience the same 24 hour days and 7 day weeks we experience, can't spend and shouldn't be expected to spend a healthy amount of their growing worth. It's also a problem that actual liquid capital (dollars and coins) ends up trickling up into complex and arcane financial entities that are far from liquid... We are suffering from a situation where businesses are becoming unsustainable trusts regardless of law because the law is no longer keeping up with how high-level finance works. The economy is becoming like a Jenga tower: Getting increasingly tall and increasingly less stable and less able to support itself.

I *will* say that there are very good reasons for America to outspend and vastly overpower every other nation on earth. The *Pax Americana* is a good thing. Hegemony is stability. Maintaining peace doesn't mean being able to win, it means being so obviously and completely able to win that only the most deranged psychopath would dare cross you. Obviously, the military budget needs to be reformed, but it needs to be reformed in the same way that entitlement programs need to be reformed - on the paperwork side. We need to find new ways to get fair bids rather than handing contractors whatever they want, and we need to find new ways to finance healthcare rather than handing insurance companies whatever they want. What we don't need is to stop maintaining our navy and air force or to stop letting old folks go to the doctor.

My Dad was in his early 80s, suffering from advanced Parkinson's... but he wanted to see Italy before it was too late. One morning in Venice, he slipped and fell, and had to be taken to the hospital by water ambulance (an adventure in itself!). A couple of hours later, my Mom called me from the hospital--they were releasing him, but couldn't give them a ride back (it was a holiday of some sort), so I needed to take his wheelchair to him. It was raining when I left the hotel with the folding wheelchair. It only weighed about 20 lbs, but it was large and awkward to carry, and there were 17 bridges (all with stairs) between me and the hospital. I dragged/carried the chair up each flight of stairs and bounced it down. By the third or fourth bridge, my legs were bruised and scraped, my hands hurt, and I was on the edge of tears. Then, on the next bridge, as I was hauling the chair up, it suddenly grew lighter in my hands. I looked around, and a man in a business suit was supporting one end of it. I thanked him... grazie... and he smiled and nodded. On the next bridge, a young couple with backpacks carried the chair for me. On the next, a pair of nuns assisted me... and so on, all the way to the hospital, across almost every bridge. On the way back, my father sat in the chair while we were on the level pathways, but we couldn't take him up the stairs in it safely--he had to get out and walk, but he was in a lot of pain. My mother assisted him while I dragged the chair (still with help from numerous strangers!), but it was slow going, and my Mom had a hard time taking his weight. On one particularly steep set of stairs, there was a young homeless man begging in a doorway. He was emaciated and long-haired--looked like he had stepped out of a painting of the pending martyrdom of a saint. He jumped up, took my father's arm, and helped us across the next few bridges, holding my father tightly, whispering to him in Italian, and stroking his hand gently. That was the longest, hardest walk of my life--I was exhausted, in pain, and very worried about both my parents--but it restored every shred of faith in humanity that I might have lost in my 38 years of life up until then. The world is full of love and kindness. tl;dr Had to drag a wheelchair halfway across Venice... unoccupied... and then back the other way, occupied. People helped. :)

Here's the letter I wrote them. Dear Microsoft, First off, I would like to commend you on your coverage of both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. I find it noble and impressive that you aim to extend the virtues and beliefs behind our democratic republic to individuals all across the world via Xbox consoles. I would like you to notice the semantics of the previous sentence, in particular the word ""aim"" because not only have you failed at this goal, but you also are doing a major disservice to the American people. I am most disgusted at your perpetuation and attempted indoctrination of the baseless two-party system. Not only have you failed to cover the conventions of any other major political party, but you even fail to note their existence. In your coverage of the Democratic convention, you offered a myriad of interactive polling questions but not once during my viewing (over 2 hours) did you leave an answer for anyone affiliating with a third party. At one point you asked ""Which party do you affiliate with?"" with the only answers being ""Democrat"", ""Republican"" or ""Independent"". You didn't even give ""Other"" as a choice. Do you see how disgusting this is? You are indoctrinating an entire generation of Xbox users into the two-party system that has wreaked havoc on our country for decades. When asking whose policy viewers most agreed with, who voters most identified with or who voters wanted to win, the only answers were Romney, Obama or ""Don't Know"". Never was ""Other"" given as a choice. Not once did I see Dr. Jill Stein or Gov. Gary Johnson appear as choice to a polling question. According to your coverage, neither of the candidates or their respective political party exist. They are running for the most powerful office in the world and you don't even acknowledge their existence?? That is utterly pathetic. Shame on you. In order for America to see real change or real progress, there needs to be high level diversity of ideas and ideals in our political system. When multiple points of view can't even make it into the discussion, our country is doomed. Although you are a massive multinational corporation, I would hope that you generally care about the welfare of the United States of America or the strength of our political system but watching the coverage tonight has made me have my doubts. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and please, if you are incapable of properly covering the presidential race, get out of politics. Sincerely, must_be_the_mangoes"

OptioMkIX	unitedkingdom	6	6	0	2012-07	1342953719	One of the most extraordinarily badly written articles I have seen from the Guardian in a long time. To claim that a Brit putting money into a tax haven deprives African governments of the money to end poverty is insane. Even if all the money washed back into Western governments and was taxed, it would no nothing for African poverty. The key issue though is that tax avoidance does not destroy the trickle down effect as it is commonly understood. That money doesn't sit in an Antiguan bank account and fester, it is invested. Those investments can't be in Antigua, they have to be around the world, and thus they create jobs and wealth around the world though the normal processes of commerce. You can argue that the profits not being taxed deprives the government of funds, but those same untaxed profits are reinvested back into companies to create more jobs and more wealth - and obviously, more profits. The question then is whether people are better off due to the effects of that untaxed investment, or if they would be better off through handouts due to higher taxes?

With the holidays nigh, I'm sure most sedditors are looking at a few flights to and from home. I wanted to suggest something you can do to hone your skills in transit. Once you find your seat on the plane, a hundred other people are going to sullenly filter past you in single file. Your challenge is to give all the attractive women (or hell, all the women period) your best, most winning smile. How many smile back at you? Does one suddenly decide to take that open seat next to you? Seriously, do this. I'm pretty shy and have a ton of AA. It's tough for me to work up the courage to open HBs in public, and I was surprised at how much of a reaction I got from women I smiled at on my flight home last night. It showed me that just as I can smile at anyone, I can talk to anyone. A smile is something that people universally react to positively. If you're worried about approach, start by building your ability to connect with a smile!

TaylorS1986	sex	2	2	0	2013-03	1363187969	Tips on BDSM for a girl who has a history of being raped. This is a little uncomfortable but here goes. A few years back I was raped. It was pretty traumatizing and involved a lot of things I correlate to BDSM in my head like holding my hands down, forcing me to be submissive, belittling, etc. I recognize this is correlation is somewhat irrational and unfair to make. I'm working on it. Anyway, I started dating someone who is fairly into BDSM. Initially, I was very put off when I found this out and contemplated breaking up with him just because of the associations I had made in my mind with BDSM and being raped. He is now super cautious when we do have sex as to not do anything that may be perceived as aggressive or forceful etc. Now that we have been dating for a while, I am much more comfortable and would like to gear some of our sexcapades to his interests like BDSM. Has anyone ever dealt with a similar situation? Any tips for slowly introducing BDSM into the bedroom? All help is much appreciated!

Therefore, the wild west analogy isn't necessarily the best one, since government can always move in and take control of a certain geographic area... In fact, this is what militaries are designed to do. However, they can't simply ""brute force"" strong encryption (yet). I've frequently heard this notion that the government could just roll into cyberspace and start demanding everyone's ""papers,"" but I keep thinking, *how exactly* would they do it, in light of tools like Tor and PGP that are already available to everyone?"

It was Hitler who smoked and quit because he didnt want an addiction to control his life. He then decided it was best to encourage a no smoking policy. From what I understood he put out a huge campaign that dehumanized smokers pressuring people to quit. In his armed forces he gave bigger portions to the soliders who were non smokers while smokers got very little. His propaganda hit every walk of life. He even said they were superior because leaders on his side were not smokers while the Allies smoked therefore was easy to defeat. Most of his beliefs came from his own interruption of smoking not scientific descoverys. So it was really just him projecting his views and forcing others to follow suit.

Shinhan	technology	7	7	0	2012-02	1330532345	It will probably fine for older systems, but the CPU (which is the most important factor in emulation capabilities) is only about as fast as a 200 MHz Pentium II so don't get your hopes too high. For example, I read on their forums (when they were up) that you should expect DosBox to only be able to run games up through the 286 era with reasonable speed. Any programs that can take advantage of the onboard GPU or use the hardware video decoding should be in much better shape (e.g. 3d games that can run natively on ARM or XBMC) if it can offload most of the processing to either of those, but emulators are mostly CPU-bound.

Before that we had smartphones with cameras facing both ways with built in microphones and transmitters and GPS. Before that we had webcams built into PCs and laptops. Our fall requires small, logical steps. Maybe some day home insurance companies will give reduced prices to people with an active Kinect-like system for claim verification purposes, if you enable their ""security cam"" app. Of course data will be stored on the cloud, as is the trend. But then it will start becoming mandatory for insurance. Then maybe banks won't even give you a loan for a home unless you have house insurance to protect their investment. Slowly but surely it will be required to haw a Kinect like system. Not bu any direct law, but by de facto, by a series of small related laws and insurance requirements. Then when everyone is used to the idea of *essentially* being required to have the system, no one will be bothered when the government steps in and begins regulating those systems directly. Stories will appear about warrantless govt access to the Kinect for people suspected of crimes. Then later whistleblower will speak of warrantless monitoring of people who disagree with the then current administration. Much like the IRS crack down on conservative groups. (As much as I dont like republicans, it's unacceptable for the govt to do this) People will still have the same attitudes they have today. ""I'd you're doing nothing wrong you have nothing to hide"" The for-profit prison system will be booming. It will rise to unprecedented levels. But no one will care that it will be an obvious modern day legal slave trade. Only the totally law abiding, obsequious and unquestioning citizens will still have their ""freedom"". Everyone else will already be a part of the prison system. And they will offer no resistance to increasing govt control, being the good, law abiding statists they are. But just to be sure there becomes no unrest, the govt will indoctrinate the kids. Then the chance of revolution by a future generation will be out of the question. Small steps. Slippery slope. Totally unlikely? Maybe. But the possibility is outlined."

Furloughed workers are to cease working immediately. They will not get paid for this time. The workers that are told to continue working will absolutely get paid when this is over. It's just a very bad situation in the meantime, and depending on a person's situation, they'll likely go look for another job if this doesn't blow over immediately.

0	Balde was a beast.	Gingermadman	soccer	2	2	0	2012-12	1355348233	What happened to them? Martin O'Neill left. The exact same thing happened at Celtic after he moved on. He brought the best out of the club and even lead us to a European Cup final which was mental looking back now. The team we lost to? Mourinho's Porto. A lot of people are critical of the wages and contracts he left behind at Villa but simple fact is he gives the fans what they want. They want to see their club operating at it's true potential and he delivered at Villa and Celtic. Sunderland however is another matter. I can only speak for Celtic and I think the only contraversial contract he left behind there was Balde who was picking up crazy money when he wasn't even starting but I don't consider this a slight on Martin by any means. As another poster pointed out, it's not the manager who signs these contracts, it's the clubs and in Celtic's case at least it was a perfect marriage.

0	And they knew to use the threat of hurting her and Brock because....	JimmyDThing	breakingbad	1	1	0	2013-09	1380136246	Because walts plan was to find Jesse, which happened. She didn't get killed in the process of finding Jesse, or even once they found him. She was killed because he tried to escape. I don't get what's so hard to see about that. Sure maybe the nazis wouldn't know about her if it wasn't for Walt, but it's not like they killed her for the hell of it. She was killed because Jesse tried to escape. It seems you're using Walt as a scapegoat to hide the fact that Jesse is the one who caused her death. If she was killed while trying to find Jesse then yes, I would see it as walts fault. But Jesse knew they knew about Andrea, yet still chose to try and escape, hence she's now deceased, because of Jesse. Just because the nazis found out about her from Walt doesn't mean it's his fault she's dead. That lands on Jesse.

An objection to ancap society by a friend that has me a little stumped. His argument was that it would be possible for very wealthy CEOs to form cartels with other companies- not necessarily of the same type, buy several private police forces and courts, (raising a private army) and then create a monopoly of violence over a geographic region, providing providing services, taxing (increasing profits for all of those in the new cartel.) This would be a government I say. He agrees. But it would ""be worse than the current one"" because it would be an oligarchy vs a democracy."" Regardless of if the new government would be better or worse, what would prevent one from potentially forming? He assures me that some people's ambition is not for money, but for political power, and that money is simply a means to this end. What do I say? Is there an answer?

It just requires a mental check to adjust where your shots are going if the target is moving. It's similar to learning a proper burst fire technique for a rifle to get good accuracy on a target, and then learning to lead targets using that bursting technique. Just learning how to be accurate full stop is more than enough to be effective, especially with things like rockets, predicting and leading targets will just come with practice.

I'm dead set on ponying up the cash to buy an H&amp;K P30. I looked at Glock's, understand they have better triggers and are much easier to service, but I'm sold on the quality with H&amp;K P30 as well as the ergonomics. Where I'm having trouble are in the details. I'm sure I want a P30 and not a P30L (long, .5 inches longer slide) because that extra length will make the gun more unwieldy to carry or handle. I'm also sure I want the .9mm and not the .40S&amp;W. I've heard too much negativity about problems with snappy recoil on the .40 as well as issues with misfiring rounds due to its compact nature. I'm also set on a trigger group, the LEM v1 (light) trigger. I would also like a model with a safety. That would be the p30s LEM v1 9mm. So, the issue is, no one sells the p30s LEM v1 in 9mm! I've found P30 LEM v2 in .40, but that's the closest I've found at local retailers. Online I've found P30 LEM v1 in 9mm, but not with the ""s"" safety. Does this gun exist? Could I get a v2 s and reconfigure the firing pin and springs?"

Hey, while watching yesterday's semi final I started realizing that watching league gets more and more boring for me. Don't get me wrong yesterday's game were really exciting but here come my thoughts: With more and more experience the amount of mistakes and throws will get lower. If this trend stays there will be a point where games are decided with first blood or the first lane losing. Right now games are exciting because the leading team makes mistakes or wrong calls. We see this trend pointed out by the analysts, too. Teams like royal or skt get one or two kills and know how to push this advantage into 3 towers and an inhib in the matter of seconds. The problem lies in the snowbally nature of league of legends. When you get a kill or an objective you get several advantages. You get ahead in gold and by getting a tower you get map control. For the team that's behind it gets harder and harder to get kills and make a comeback. When we compare league to a traditional sport like soccer you can see why it's different. When a team in soccer is 3 goals ahead it is very likely that this team will win, but the losing team can score a goal any time. It doesn't matter if they are 3 goals behind. Goals don't give you power. Kills and towers do. To sum it up: With growing experience of the players the amount of mistakes will get lower and lower until there will be no more mistakes. This means due to the snowbally nature of league that once a team gets ahead this team will win and games will be decided after a few minutes. This will result in a very boring experience for the viewer and this is the reason why I think league as an sport will die in the near future. In addition to that I think that I'm an addict. I watched 80% of the wc so far play league every day for hours and even talk and think about it in my free time. More casual players will lose the interest even faster. What do you think about it? Let's have a discussion!

Apart from the center of the screen being slightly darker than the edges, I absolutely loved it. That is, until I noticed a pair of *dust particles in between the screen layers* in the lower left corner; when the light is on, they create very bright pinpricks of light. As tiny as they are, they were distracting to the point that I contacted Amazon this Tuesday, during which they immediately sent out a new one. It arrived today and to my horror, *there are a pair of parallel 2-3 mm long scratches in the upper left corner!* Now, for whatever reason, they don't shine and are practically invisible when reading a book and I might have decided to keep this replacement except for the fact that the *screen looks almost sepia next to my first one.* Now I'm not sure whether to contact them again for a third one or pick one of the two I have. This, however, is not something the consumer should have to go through! Seriously Amazon, get your $h1t together!

He then slowed down and the officer became impatient and chose to tailgate this driver until he couldn't take it any longer. After that, he illegally redirected him to a slower lane just so he could get where he wanted to go at a speed well above the limits. Officers who speed and don't have their lights flashing are the ones who anger me most. They are supposed to not only enforce the law but they are supposed to uphold it in actions as well.

Dusty_Buckets	AskReddit	-2	-2	0	2013-07	1373162202	What I find amazing is how in one lifetime, a certain commander can conquer a huge part of the world. One example is Genghis Khan. In his life, he commandeered his armies to unite lots of tribes in his country, then took over most of Asia, and half of Europe. You just don't see that again. I highly doubt we will in our lifetime. Probably the most recent example would have been Hitler, but that was nowhere near as much Genghis Khan.

1	I hate it when bad players keep rebuying and driving up the amount in the purse	tehFdo	poker	7	7	0	2013-07	1374252837	How to run a successful tournament game with rebuys My friends and I have been playing a tournament style poker game with a 20 dollar buy in on a regular basis for a few years. We have always allowed rebuys for around an hour, sometimes two. Initially it didn't bother anyone but now the player pool has changed and so have the games. These days we tend to have extremely reckless play during the opening hands, people playing mediocre hands or draws and going all in very early. This almost invariably results in a number of very early double ups, or triple sometimes. While this is great when someone goes all in against me and I know I have them beat, it seems harsh on those players who don't get their spots early in the game. I was wondering what options exist to try and discourage this kind of play yet still not exclude someone if they do happen to get unlucky despite playing sensibly? Or am I just thinking about this in the wrong way?

After that they laughed for a couple minutes and talked about just how cool that would be if someones kid wound up charging hundreds to their parents card without them being aware. If anyone here believes this is completely the parents fault and the game isn't rigged from the start to play into scenarios like this - then they are naive. This entire post is a circlejerk about how much smarter people here are than these hypothetical ""stupid parents"" - which is about par for the course on Reddit, but ultimately, everyone is just here to touch on their own dick and laugh at someone else's misfortune."

Our society has it in our minds that **rape = stranger jumping out from a dark alleyway/bushes to brutally penetrate a woman at gunpoint**. Everybody needs to know that sexual assault typically happens between people who already know each other. And that rapists are typically serial rapists - there's generally not just one instance of assault. Us guys don't seem to have it figured out that sexual assault encompasses a whole range of sexual activity where there is no consent. ""Maybe? Ehhhh"" is not consent. Drunkenness and/or body languages that says ""No"" (while perhaps not outright saying ""No, get the fuck away"" is not consent). A lot of guys are walking around with really false and harmful understandings of what ""rape"" means, so we have people like the rapists in this case able to ""justify"" it to themselves that they're not committing a heinous crime."

You can write or say anything critisizing the government; worst thing you can get is being sued for insults and pay some fine (if there was an insult ofc). The number of jailed journalist is high because, many are accused of being part of military coup plans. That is a controversial case of course, but one has to make the dintinction that they are not jailed just because they are anti government.

For whatever reason, they will clamor all dy about the growing divide between the rich and the poor, but refuse to acknowledge that the poor are getting poorer because they are dependent upon government programs. Food stamps and unemployment will not make you rich. As inflation continues to rise (particularly in food prices), these programs will continue to buy less and less, thus making those who depend on it poorer and poorer.

I work at a face painting company. We have all sorts of designs from dragons to tigers to princess crowns. I am faced with parents roping their children into only getting designs that fit their child's gender everyday. ""Don't get the Unicorn, that's for girls."" or ""Don't get the spider that's for boys."" Well yesterday, a little boy who couldn't have been more than 6 or 7 years old came up to our stand and clearly stated, ""I want the princess crown"". Now the staff is very liberal and will paint whatever you want, as long as the parents will pay so we waited for the mother's responses to this request (in my mind sadly expecting her to veer his course to a different design). She said, ""is that what you want? Alright let's do it!"" I was overjoyed. While my coworker painted his face with pinks, purples, and whites, I chatted with the mother. I told her that I really appreciated her letting him get that with no qualms, and I was impressed by how little he had worried about the normally gendered design. She said, ""Oh he knows gender is just a social construct."" I laughed out of shear joy in meeting someone who not only believed this but had also effectively raised their child to act within that belief system. I told the customer she had been my favorite all day and would have given her a discount if I could. I don't know if this woman was straight or queer (she was with another woman who didn't seem to have any children with her) but it was a very exciting experience to see gender norms thwarted out in the real world so matter-of-factly. Great day at work. Thought I would share."

I attempted to get the moms attention but she was obliviously ordering at the counter. So then I got the girls attention to try and stop her from putting crap in her mouth. Not by touching her or even approaching her, just by making stupid sounds that kids like so that she would stare at me. The mother notices me and her kid looking and making noises to each other and flips out. I try explaining to her why I was getting her childs attention to no avail. She proceeds to tell her kid that she can do whatever she wants and to never let a white man tell her what to do. Sigh

I was looking at her shoes."" She replies, ""I know what creeps like you are after, and you won't get my little girl!"" More staring ensues, but boyfriend, witty as ever, says, ""Trust me, lady, she's not my type."" She still doesn't catch a clue, and continues to shriek (at the top of her lungs, mind you) about how my boyfriend was a pedo and she was going to call the police. At this point, my boy is just shaking his head. I felt it appropriate to pop my two cents into the argument, and said to her, ""Would you stop harassing my boyfriend? No one was looking at your kid. You wanna know how I know? I pointed out her shoes, and he pointed out that they were knock offs."" Her reply: ""What does that have any-- oh. oh, wait. Are you two... *together*?"" We nodded. She turned pale as a ghost and ran away. It still infuriates my man. TL;DR- Crazy woman accuses two fags of eyeing her badly-dressed 13 year old daughter, then takes off when she realizes she's made a fool of herself."

This isn't a case where someone stole a candy bar and the cops decided not to press charges, someone killed a fucking kid. Every one of those officers is sworn to uphold the law and protect people. Even if the entire department flipped out and started pressuring the officers/detectives/chief/whoever into doing something then I can't imagine they would still not make an arrest or at least do some more investigating. Police officers who idly stand by and let stuff like this happen are just as bad as the police officers perpetuating this kind of bullshit.

1	Ca you do it in all lowercase?	WhyHellYeah	AskReddit	-1	-1	0	2012-04	1334394249	**Here it is in paragraphs:** I am hoping that my expertise in this area will be of assistance to you sir. My previous job title was Mortgage Counselor for a non profit organization that was took calls through the hopeline (1.888.995.HOPE) in which I worked for over 4 years when the housing market was beginning to slide. Let me begin by stating that I can understand how difficult of a time this must be for you especially given that you provide for 3 children. I am going to write a briefing here, but if you have any questions for me feel free to ask away as I will do whatever I can to make sure that you go through this with an understanding of your options and the pros and cons of each. As others have stated, I would be very cautious about using the 401k for various reasons... It should be a last resort and you should know what you are getting into. Withdrawing early will lead you to pay penalties(30% sounds about accurate) but another thing you should know is that if you still have a balance on your mortgage loan, paying off 2/3s or 3/4s or whatever it amounts to will not lower your monthly payments. What I am saying here is that it would be a shame to withdraw your entire 401k to pay off 100k and still owe 30 or so. It will not put you in a position to refinance as you are currently unemployed and you could still lose the house to foreclosure if you fail to continue with the payments even after reducing the overall balance. Your best bet if you plan to keep the house is to either find good tenants that will cover the mortgage and keep your property in good standings... [Err] on the side of caution, perform background checks or at least tell prospective tenants that you plan on a background and credit check as this will likely scare off prospective bad tenants from even trying to rent your property. Seek out employment(I'm actually assuming that you are) and if you have to take a lesser job with lesser pay in order to provide for your family than there may still be a chance at working out a loan modification to change the terms of your loan and retain ownership. Other things to consider are just straight selling the home. I am unsure if you have any equity in your home at the moment or if it would be considered underwater, meaning that you owe more that the current market value of the home. Either way selling the home is not a horrible option, though difficult when you have kids enrolled in school and such. If you have equity, then selling the home can allow you seed money to float you while you seek employment and a rental property to keep a roof over your head. If you owe more than the home is worth, than you can attempt a short sale of the home(alerting your mortgage company of your financial hardship and listing the home with a realtor for short sale purposes) doing this does 2 things, shows your lender that you're willing to work with them thus sometimes stalling foreclosure processes if and/or when you fall behind on payments. Also, many lenders offer relocation assistance upon successful completion of a short sale. Sorry for the long post as I just wanted to put as much info out there that I can fit, but again, if you have additional questions I am happy to help. You can also call 888.995.HOPE for free and discuss your situation in detail with a counselor... Bear in mind that they will put together a report to send your lender after you talk with them so if you don't want your lender to know about this yet, make sure to inform the counselor that you do not wish for them to send your lender any information regarding your conversation until you have discussed all options with your family 1st.

1	woohoo i can't wait to be virgun until 35	cohrt	funny	1	1	0	2012-01	1326074450	"I understand how frustrating the friendzone thing is, but here is my experience: Right through university I didn't have any girlfriends, no sex involving more than just me, in fact, no dating at all, and I was stuck firmly in friendzone. After graduating, I complained about this to everybody who would listen, and my boss at work explained it thus: being popular with women is based on being cool when you are young, and on being successful when you are middle aged. You will never be cool, but have a chance of being successful. So, I focused on that. By the time I was mid 30s, I was doing well in my career (ran my own software firm) and decided to try dating again. It was a completely different story. This time, good looking women were no longer treating me like a laughable geek, but told me I was sexy because I was a ""highflying businessman"". Looking back, the guys who were popular when I was 18 are just ordinary blokes nowadays, often married to a no-longer-attractive woman for a couple of decades and in a job they hate. The guys my age who are getting all the good looking women are the guys who used to be geeky like me, and made something of themselves careerwise. So, I went from ""forever alone"" at 18, to married at 38 to a woman who is breathtakingly beautiful, is brainier than me, and has a highflying career of her own. Be patient guys, the pain you feel now will pass, and in a decade or two, you will be the guy that other men are jealous of and that women are chasing after."

Wade, the court didn't accidentally forget what the Constitution said. In this case, as the guy below pointed out, the decision rested on the Constitutional right to privacy, which was found to exist in a previous case,*Griswold v. Connecticut*.

Google Maps services are free, and it only looks like they changed the appearance of the dots. Condoms are also very cheap; especially compared to the risks of unprotected sex (STIs, unwanted pregnancy, etc). I know if you went to a PP office and asked for condoms they will be more than glad to give you a whole bunch like it's candy. I think it's great that they're trying to promote safe sex. Sometimes you have to do something a little different/quirky to reach a different age group/generation. Sure, you hear it all the time in school, by your peers, parents, etc ""make sure to wear a condom and practice safe sex!"", but how many people are actually going to do just because they're told? Now with this campaign they have an incentive to do it other than just doing what they're told. People will think it's fun and might start thinking twice next time they have unprotected sex. They might start associating safe sex with something more interesting/fun than just something they ought to do."

Hi fellow Smiters, For those of you who don't know, Isis's passive is Funeral Rites, where she gains 2hp5 and 2mp5, sharing them as an aura with her nearby teammates, for each god death she witnesses, up to 10 resetting on death. I'm kind of new to Smite, but I feel like her passive is incredibly weak. If I get involved in 3 kills, I'm barely getting the benefit of a Watcher's Gift's regen. It resets on my death, so I have a hard time stacking it beyond 5-7 stacks unless I'm going to win the game easily anyway. It seems very counterintuitive to Isis's play over the last ~8 months. Isis has pretty much been a mid since she came out, so the aura portion of this passive seems to have next to no value in either lane or in teamfights. Does anyone have any ideas on how to make this passive better or how I can start playing it to my advantage, because she's easily my favourite midlaner. Thanks friends.

Let me break this down for you: The WHOLE WORLD is a sex club. If you think that you're at greater risk of being cheated on just because you take your wife to a sex club, you are MAXIMUM NAIVE. What happens in the WORLD (a sex club, remember) is that you get a partner, you talk about what your agreements are regarding who can have what kind of contact with who, and once you agree on something, anything outside of that agreement is cheating. Shit happens all the time. What happened IN THE ACTUAL SEX CLUB was not different from that in the slightest bit. Your wife cheated on you in front of your face and she was well aware that she was doing so. Please treat this situation as if she had done this without the convenient cover of being in a ""place where sex happens"" (as if that's any different from the rest of the world). I can't speak for you, but if I were you I would drop my trust for her to 0 and I would begin making moves to either change agreements with her about what kind of contact with others is acceptable or exit the relationship. You can't be with someone who breaks the rules you set about who you're allowed to fuck, so get to changing the rules, or get away from her, but please don't buy her story about how nothing happened when it so clearly did."

1	well of course its not like black people do anything else other than commit crime right?	_retarded_retard_	news	1	1	0	2014-02	1392841412	"When i was 21, i was walking home from a party with a black man. A police cruiser pulled up and the officer (also black, over 40) pulled a gun on me when i walked over to chat with him. After screwing with me and the other guy for nearly an hour, with 4 other cruisers called, the whole time accusing me of buying crack from him and combing a nearby yard with flashlights for that same hour... they let us go. The first officer pulled over about 20 minutes later, as i was still walking home, and informed me that the reason he drew on me was because it was suspicious that a black man and white man were walking together at night. He even kept saying, ""you have to admit..."" I just kept telling him not to be racist and not to be an arse. Finally he made up some song and dance about how long the other guy's arrest record was, and how i wasn't very wise and should choose my friends better. It was all BS... just a hair away from getting shot myself from a jumpy cop looking for any reason. We were walking. This was Alabama, where interracial walking = violent drug gangbangers."

1	For the record, you know, he didn't build that.	tpx187	Conservative	2	2	0	2014-02	1393351545	"My dad came to America from Pakistan in the early 80s, with $20 in his pocket, to go to college. He worked 3 jobs, trying to support both his tuition, his new wife's tuition, living expenses, and eventually my brother and I. By today's liberal logic, he is poor, and therefore not a ""bad person"", just a ""victim of capitalism"". Fast forward 30 years, he's now running a multimillion dollar construction company that he built up at the cost of his health, and building himself a $500k house. So my question to the left is, ""What changed that now my dad must be punished through heavy taxes and regulation, and the ire of the left's ""We demand you employ us on our terms"" philosophy. Is it because he worked hard, and earned money counter to their mindset? Is it because he's building a beautiful, well deserved, home instead of ""giving the money back""? For that matter, there is a contradiction. If having money made him a ""rich bad guy"", then why would you want to put that ""evil"" on yourself by taking some of his money for your food stamps? Democrats are completely unaware of the fact they live counter to their beliefs, that they are inherently selfish. And according to the Liberal Utopia doctrine, even one selfish person is a curse on the system. I guess in this case, 1+1 =/= 2. Instead, following liberal mathematical theorem, 1+1 = whatever makes you feel good about yourself, through rampant self-justification."

At the same time, I think it's a better fit for both parties if they part ways. The Kings are acquiring athletes and building for the future. Based on the moves we made, it seems like we're trying to build a run-and-gun team. In a way, the players kind of remind me of what we had in the late 90s/early 2000s; our big men can pass and everyone else can shoot and finish on the break. JT is too slow to fit in with the new culture. Someone with Thompson's size and talent should be playing somewhere that needs a guy who provide toughness and some offensive options. He could definitely play a big role on a contender, so why stick him on a rebuilding team that favours athleticism?

The huge confusion that formed after the attacks amongst the Western public (though mostly the US public) probably turned some people to religion as they sought answers or solutions to this act of terror. Alot of the public probably wondered why the US was being attacked - it was the land of opportunities, a place to be free. Also, the fact it was committed by radical muslims would've strengthened, and in some cases, radicalised, Christian beliefs, as they felt their way of life was being attacked. Fundamentalists create fundamentalists.

Seanctk10001	gaming	-5	-5	0	2013-07	1375223722	Half of the fights aren't even against those zombie-like creatures, but against other people. Also those infected are way more interesting than zombies. For example, the clickers are completely blind but they have very good hearing. When mixed with runners you end up with pretty interesting and intense stealth and combat encounters. The resource system is very well thought out. You often have to make choices like, should I make another nail bomb? Maybe I'll need a knife. What about making a health kit? You can't go forward randomly and expect to finish it like a pure-action game. What I'm trying to say is, the last of us isn't just a zombie game. It's a pretty good game, you should trust Naughty Dog on this one, play it.

That said, the whole argument that anything is ""because of evolution"" is a bid misleading. It's usually framed as if there were some problem, and then the species evolved to solve the problem, which makes it sound like it was a conscious effort and only good things come out of mutation. All features originally arise from mutation, so bad features (or sometimes side effects of good ones) do too, and if they're not detrimental enough to outweigh the benefits, then they may not disappear. Suicide and depression are features of the same complicated neural system that gives us fear and disgust, which are generally used to avoid danger."

0	Agreed 100% Lest we forget *this is not a PvP server*.	xb4r7x	HardcoreSMP	-1	-1	0	2013-07	1373935785	"Please don't remove opples. Its another kick in the teeth for people who don't engange in pvp on acount of those whoi do. Golden apples have valid uses outside of pvp combat; fighting a wither boss say, or taking an imprompu lava bath in the nether. Yes opples are, as the moniker implies extremely powerful, they are also cost ineffective requiring over a full stack of gold to produce one. If someone happens to be carrying 5 opples this means that they took the time to mine up 360 gold ore, even with the auriferous terrain gen thats no small feat. But pvpers don't like that because said player might be able to escape or defeat them ccourtesy of their opples so they want them removed. This is asinine and completely unfair. Anytime you engage in pvp you run the risk that your opponent has you outgunned, whether via opples, potions or better enchants/armor. This has always been the case and likely always will. A few more things to consider: How many people have had this problem compared to the number of people who regularly play on the server? Any nerf or mod to opples would likely be as forthcoming as the modifications to enderchests, that is to say, not at all. Finally, I find it bizarre that anyone would be squealing for a ""fair fight"" on server where perfidy and murder are the order of the day. If you're expecting an honourable duel between equals i'd advise look elsewhere or accept and expect that your challenger might not play fair."

Aren't other women also to blame for this behavior? My girl friend always says when I do something she doesn't like ""I dont reward bad behavior"". Every woman who uses her looks to get ahead, every woman who takes advantage of her sexual position to persuade a man drives this point just a little further. Every time this behavior is rewarded it demeans your cause. It's not just ""Creepers"" who are to blame for this its also the women who enabled the behavior."

I don't think we know much about the origins of the Devils Fruits or when in history they started showing up. We know Shiki the Lion had a Devils Fruit ability, so at the very least they were around during Gol. D Rogers era on the seas. Maybe the ""D"" family were the original creators of the Devils Fruits originally and because the Fruits were originally designed to work exclusively with the D family genetics, they have a higher capacity for the Fruits than normal people in the current day. Over time as the D genetics were slowly thinned out and spread across the globe the population eventually became compatible enough with the Devils Fruits to use them too. Just speculation, but it's kinda fun to think about."

But he did not. He indirectly denigrated Aquinas, not once, but twice. Aquinas is the model for a priest. This is in Canon Law - priests should model themselves after Aquinas. Additionally, Aquinas is the patron saint of education, which, symbolically, means that he is the pinnacle of what RCC priests and schoolchildren should attempt to be. His cavalier dismissal of Aquinas, and not just his quote, really made me think bullshit. I was already thinking of that because he ignored requests for proof, which is a cornerstone of AMA, and he knew it. If it were anything else other than someone a priest, meaning just the word, people would clamor for proof and be quick to say it is bulshit. But stick on the label ""priest"" and all of a sudden, the person does not have to follow the rules. This is how children get fucked in the ass. People, like you, are idiots. Why are you giving this unknown person a free pass?"

A guy came in with all of these, as well as a ton of old pen and paper RPG stuff from the 70s and 80s (I think... that stuff is in a box). I'm in the process of moving now, so I thought I'd lay 'em out and see if anybody recognizes these things. Most of his pen and paper stuff was LoTR stuff, so I have a feeling most of these are LoTR (Hobbits, the old black orcs with horns and big teeth, ""army"" figures). Most are Ral Partha, some are grenadier, and others I haven't checked yet. WARNING: These were taken by my cell phone, on the floor of my living room (which is dirty. . . I'm packing). Many are missing hands/weapons, and some of the pics are upside down and the flash looks like crap, etc etc. I'm not very good at this. Those with OCD might not want to look. Regardless, I like the little collection and would like to paint most of them someday. They're all metal, heavy, so pewter/lead/?? Any insight as to what some of them are would be appreciated. I can take individual shots if anybody wants, but I am packing them up tomorrow afternoon. Sorry again for crappy quality. Just on-the-spot decided to take photos of them all. I need to find foam to put them in or something, as currently they're in baggies in a big box. Thanks in advance for any help.

I take a toot on the Coolcumber, all the while thinking, it's not a bad juice, the quality is there, but... that darn cucumber! I'm taking a look at my other bottles, and all of sudden, an idea! That Hawk Sauce is sitting there, not being used (don't care much for it), but I took off the cap, took a sniff, and decided, why not? Eureka! 50/50 of each in the tank, and it tastes just perfect! I thought I'd share this with you, and if you feel like it, I'd love to hear about your own winning on-the-moment mixing experiments! In the meantime, have a great Saturday night :)

1	If lower tax rates on capital gains didn't make me poor, I'd give you gold	no_more_jokes	politics	1	1	0	2013-12	1387163226	"If you tax capital gains at ordinary rates, you would crush your returns on more aggressive investments (such as the stock market), and thus start to make more conservative investments much more attractive. That would cripple the economy. These ""rich people and their capital gains"" are what funds every public company, every bank, and pretty much any business that has ever taken a dime of funding. For example, let's take an 8% return on a stock with a 40% federal tax on the capital gains (plus let's say you live in a state with another 8% state taxes on capital gains). That 8% return is quickly whittled down to an effective post-tax return of just a hair over 4%. Alternatively, I could invest that money in a stable tax-free municipal bond with a 3.5% return. That .5% delta is *not* even close to worth the risk one would take to invest in stocks. Capital gains are not just there to save rich people money, they are there to keep money pumping into the economy and foster economic growth."

He insists that I'll change my mind and will want to have kids in the future. I keep saying that I don't (I'm 23 and he's 19-21) but he doesn't listen. I say that I'll physically abuse my kids (I really wouldn't hurt anyone). I say that I'll be working long hours (nights, weekends, holidays. The life of a chef is hard) and have barely any money for myself, let alone another human being. His answer is that I'll make a wonderful mother. Doesn't mean I should be one ... What I want to say to him is that I'll change my mind when he comes out of the closet (possibly closeted gay) or when he loses weight (fad diets ain't doing it for him). I'm too nice to say those things. It's so incredibly frustrating to me when he thinks he knows me more than I know myself. His condescending tone doesn't help either.

I loved to root for Mr White a 50 year old man with cancer who was always the nerd got to feel some real power and he over came all obstacles by his smartness is now simply going to end up dead or in jail. They have him on audio, they have Jesse confession. Loved this show so much but I'm just going to stop watching it now since it will only make me hate the show.. Ray Donovan is better now anyways.

1	Guys, there's no counter play to Ryze's abilities, they're all targeted abilities and you can't even flash away because they follow you or are instantaneous and hit you instantly Riot plz nerf nao	thebrundlfly	leagueoflegends	1	1	0	2013-09	1378592910	Fizz Q On-hit gives his victims no possibility to counterplay With a lichbane, fizz Q does insane damage while also applying his W passive (and active if activated). His main combo is simply to jump to you and afterwards a Q that he only has to click on you: 2 abilities and maybe an ult if the target isnt dead. Every other assassin has to use his full kit to do that. Zed uses his shadow followed by Q,E and autoattack while Khazix uses his Leap-W-passivehit-Q combo. The difference: you can avoid the rest of their kit while you cant do that with fizz. He has to click his Q on you to apply the damage, lichbaneproc and W passive and active. You have no time to react to that! Removing the On-Hit ability from Q would solve this easily. To make it clear: It won't lower his damage! By removing the on-hit effect from Q, everything you would have to do to reach the same damage than before is to use one single autoattack after your Q. Thats shouldn't be that hard to achive. But it would give the victim time to react. Since his Q is also kind of a click-to-close-gap ability its impossible to avoid all the damge from him, while on the other assassins, you simply flash away when you see they shadow/leap to you. TL;DR: You cant dodge Fizz Q, so make it at least necessary for him to hit you with an autoattack after his Q to deal the same damage.

You don't even need to consume very much to gain a good portion of the effects and it could really help someone out who is looking to develop or play with a Rift but who suffers from bad motion sickness. That said - I don't recommend strolling down the street looking to score a dime bag, but if you can acquire it safely and consume it in moderation, it's worth a try. These wrist bands, on the other hand, are not worth a try. At absolute best, you'd gain the benefit of a placebo effect and while in some limited cases, placebos can rival actual medication for potency, mostly you'll just feel like a dumbass for wasting your money.

1	Well thank you **tha_troll21** for your troll insight.	jij	atheism	2	2	0	2011-11	1320416230	"Religion, and why it matters (or doesn't) Religion The thing is, when someone says that some prayers to God go unanswered, this is true, the same would be for why the millions of prayers for the starving people in (insert here), only with this the reason being because they deserve it. See the Christianity is one religion, but like any religion, it has its bullshit flaws. It would make more sense that all the religions are somewhat one in the same (not going to discuss here because I could write a book explaining everything, and not just one religion like how mary wasn't a virgin, but every religion), so think of it like this; Hitler was a cunt, after he died, he probably came back, maybe he was held as a child and tortured, just as he had done to so many others. I'm not saying go out and torture kids because karma says they'll deserve it, nor do I condone it, but it does make sense if you look at the BIG PICTURE. On a side note, it's funny how many atheists there are. I like to think if there is a satan, devil, what have you, (only talking as if Christianity was the only truth here) then more than likely look how happy he would be with how many ""stupid asses"" as he would no doubt put it because he would have claimed so many souls. How unfortunate though it doesn't work like that, nor should it because if Christianity was the only way into heaven, or whatever, then that means you get one chance then youre done. That's fucking stupid no matter how you spin it, and people as a whole and in general (I'm talking to you public) are fucking stupid*. So it only makes sense if there's more to it than just one book, one religion, one life. That we're born again and again to learn from past lives mistakes, religions are only a guide if we need it. Think about it. *The reason I call people in general stupid is because well look at us, we've had two world wars and we're still having wars. The purpose of this was to get people thinking, not upset/arguing. So have an open mind people :D"

It later came out that her father was abusive to her when she was growing up and during the time I had her she was having to take care of him as he was too weak to do so himself. In order to cope with it all she was drinking quite a bit and even came to parent teacher night so drunk/high that she had to hold her hand down to the table with her other hand because she couldn't stop moving it. She was asked to move to another school I think the year after I had her, and eventually was fired from that school for who knows what reason.

0	The way that half the games revert to demos when one's internet connection is down sure doesn't promote use of the service.	Jataka	Games	3	3	0	2011-12	1324463358	"What is holding PSN and XBLA back from huge sales like Steam's Holiday Sale? Most of us love steam sales, even if it ends up that we pay steam for the privilege of owning games we never play. It's such good marketing to constantly be making people thing ""I am stupid if I DON'T buy"". It promotes games people may not have heard about, causing more and more sales. PSN and XBLA have sales, but they are not nearly on the same level. The discounts are never significant or the base price is already outlandish. Why would I be excited for a game that is 20$ after a 50% discount when I can walk to a store and buy it new for 15$? I know it's probably to do with them not pressuring third parties and what not, but I wanted to ask if anyone had more insight, or if I am just blind and never see the 75% of deals and such on those services."

Zombies kinda-sorta made a huge splash soon after that with L4D and various wannabes... but nothing has really knocked the big WW2 and Modern Shooter archetypes off their platform. We're going to be stuck with modern warfare for quite some time, I'll bet. Although developers seem to be trying to push for post-apocalyptic wastelands with Rage and Borderlands... we'll see if that takes... I think a big thing is that the fratbros and gun nuts see any science-fiction or fantasy setting as gay nerd stuff.

I would just rather we talked more about tightening the rules, which really are incredibly vague and confusing, and we had less of pointing the finger at politicians.

The part about the author's dad telling him that straight people won't trust him because they prefer to trust their own kind really hit home for me, as I was able to draw a parallel with my own mother telling me not to hang out with white people as they will always see me as inferior and prefer to associate with other whites. I think as bigots Asian parents are often unjustifiably paranoid of others' bigotry and overestimate the number of bigots around them, e.g. my parents are racist against Caucasians and fear the same of my Caucasian friends and the author's father fears the author's friends may be homophobic since he himself is.

As if there were a chance of that being the case.That's like saying a mother hugging his heterosexual son could be misconstrued as sexual. O.O"

WhyYouThinkThat	AdviceAnimals	3	3	0	2013-07	1372710852	As much as I agree that may be the case, it isn't a good policy to so easily excuse a politician that promised one thing to get elected and then behaved in a way that broke that promise after getting elected... Some may see that as a betrayal of the American people. He was elected based on what policies he supported during pre-election, and turning around and flipping on those positions after said positions won him the presidency is like a slap in the face to the people who voted for him. It could be that he learned intel that led to a better understanding of the necessity of surveillance, but it could also be the sign of a dirty politician who led a misleading campaign to acheive an agenda. Either way, you are right that no one knows what is going on in America so maybe it's best to hold our elected officials to a certain standard of honesty. Though I'm not sure how reddit is actually going to make a difference in any of this one way or another, so who really cares what gets posted here? I doubt that the NSA spends time surfing the front page, so let's not kid ourselves. Write a letter to your senators and other elected officials if you want to be heard guys...

I am what is known to society as an ""Oreo"". For those of you who don't know, that means I am a black person who doesn't act like a stereotypical gangster, Soul brother, or Jock. The Term Oreo is more racist and offensive than the word nigger. Let me explain why. The term nigger is a degrading classification of a type of people. If you call me a nigger, there is some truth to that, historically speaking. Slave owners would call their black slaves niggers. The Term Oreo means that I am not acting like a media induced stereotypical black person, which is 100% OF THE TIME DEFINED AS sagging pants, loud and brute ignorance, pugnaciousness, being extremely disrespectful, and less educated. If you call anyone an Oreo, you promoting the fact that Black people act differently as a people than anybody else. I'll be the last person to disagree with you that black people growing up in what is called the ""Ghetto"" and more ""Hood"" parts of the United States act differently that a black person raised in the suburbs. I grew up in ""The Hood"" and I don't act like that, because my mother would have beat me to death had i acted like that. And I am not the only one. Calling me an Oreo is essentially saying I am not Black. Excuse my rudeness for the moment when i say WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT I AM? Both of my parents are Black, both grew up in the 70s and the 80s, My mother grew up poor, and she made sure i wouldn't become like she was, only getting one pair of shoes for 3 years and worrying how to eat. And you have the audacity to say ""You aren't black"" Because I'm not Poor, uneducated, and don't have the same role models as a hoodrat does? Fuck you and the boat you came in on."

1	Because it's impossible for every other race but white to be racist, don't you know that?	Wattsherfayce	offmychest	2	2	0	2013-07	1373977123	I am not Trayvon Martin (probably not what you'd expect) I'm a white, working class female from the deep South, and I have more than one close friend grew up dirt poor. Let me tell you something about reality: Cops where I'm from don't give a damn what race you are. If you're solidly middle/upper class, you're golden, but if you look like you're poor or are a young male of any race, you're getting hassled. Just because you're white doesn't magically make you immune to police suspicion and routine abuse. If you dress like a stereotypical hood, people don't care what color you are, you *will* be followed. Matter of fact, I've heard more than one person say that when it comes to petty theft, you always want to watch the whites because generally if a black person is going to steal, they're usually at least going to try to make it worth their while and go big or go home. Just because you're white doesn't magically make you accepted by the middle class and upper class. Middle/upper class Southern whites HATE their poor and the poor are extremely socially marginalized. Just because you're white doesn't mean you're exempt from social marginalization, police brutality and suspicion, and general societal scorn. So, please, tell me all about how you're not Trayvon and about how your skin color is magic teflon against the real world that exists out there. And please, please, act like you understand where the poor crackers that are, admittedly, being racist assholes about this whole thing are coming from. Because, let me tell you, where they're coming from is this: if it was them, nobody would care. They don't have an NAACP to scream and holler and rile the media up until charges are brought. If they go to a shitty school with drafty classrooms, intense overcrowding, and ancient (or nonexistent) books, nobody gives a damn because they're white. If they get beaten and routinely harassed by cops, there's no civil rights statute they can invoke or civil rights watch dogs they can call in to make it stop. If they happen to be being mistreated by a black person, all that black person has to do is breath about racism, and they're automatically labeled as a racist and SOL. Please tell me how white privilege is some kind of magic stick for me, as a working class white, to be able to climb the ladder into the middle class and have a decent life. Please, let your white guilt ooze out of those little pours of yours. Because I have **none**.

0	Inb4 Boots+3 nerfed; complaints about Doran's meta too stale...	RickAtCU	leagueoflegends	1	1	0	2012-10	1351206058	Why boots and 3 pots is so optimal in League of Legends, and why it is not healthy for the Meta if we expect it to change. Everybody who has played a substantial amount of League of Legends has heard of, actively uses, and hates on others who don't, run boots and 3 pots as a first buy. I would like to demonstrate why this is not a productive buy when considering changing the meta in any way, shape, or form. League of Legends, Starcraft, Dota, and pretty much any other strategy game ever, has a base concept of positioning of where a player should be when trying to attempt a certain objective. I.E. ganking, taking baron, (and non LoL examples) taking a new base in Starcraft, and where a sniper should be in the new XCOM game. Positioning is a key element to a good LoL player at any level and is emphasized by every single ability a champion has, by either range (annie's ult), or cast width (Lux's entire kit). Another concept I think I see in all games (I cannot say for sure as i have only watched SC, and Dota) is the idea of having sustainability or health regeneration. For some champions in league this is two-fold (Vladimir) and is purely absurd to give some champions that sort of limitation in choice for items. (Luckily Riot has made sure Vladimir's early game isn't all that great for damage output.) So the problem I see is that Riot gives people the option to have, at a relatively low cost, 2 very important concepts of game play at the start of the game with no real other option than to go defensive. If Riot wishes to generate more early game aggression, as they have stated in the past, then i suggest they change boots lvl 1. First thought to a change for Boots 1 is to make it more expensive, (perhaps 430) in order for there to be a real cost to the amount of health regen a champion can have in taking the boots 1 route. Another thought that occurred was to completely prevent players from buying movement speed from the shop without sufficient funds. Perhaps it could be 600 gold (generic number that could be tweaked easily) so that players cannot choose it all which immediately makes me feel that the Doran's items would become much more viable. I do not believe the upgrade to boots 2 or 3 should cost more, but instead scale directly with the cost of boots 1. Example: Beserker Greaves cost 970, (i think) therefore the upgrade from boots 1 to Beserker Greaves would be relatively cheap just as it is now anyway. Last thought but most likely more controversial is to completely remove boots 1 from the game and have a flat upgrade in movement speed to the boots 2 set we already have. (With adjustments in power and usefulness in all boots to ascertain balance) This idea i have not considered nearly as much but may have more benefits than drawbacks. SO! In conclusion, i believe that giving 2 core concepts of the game to players (the ability to position, and health regen) is bad for the early game Meta, and should be changed in some way (by no means required to be any of my suggestions). TLDR; Boots, 3 pots meta is stale. GET RID OF IT! (Probably screwed up my grammar, if this gets attention i will edit it for the wider community to see.)

0	Very well explained sir.	malarie	Android	1	1	0	2012-07	1342499437	"The bootloader on the Verizon SIII is locked right now. There's a lot of talk about this being changed with a software update and even more talk about how that talk was incorrect, so as a first-timer I would play with it for a while and then determine if there's anything you want to change, then research and ask more specific questions. If all you're worries about is bloatware, the SIII's hardware means that most of those apps won't bog down anything. As far as the ads, if an app is pushing ads to your notification bar, downloading and app called ""Airpush Detector"" from the Play Store will tell you which apps are doing this so you can uninstall them. However, I have a feeling you are more so referring to in-app ads. Most of these are due to the app being free and can be eliminated by purchasing the paid versions. Gmail is constantly becoming better a syncing, so you might just want to forward your other email addresses to Gmail and have them all in one place. If not, the stock email app should allow you to sync multiple email accounts and even name them. If you haven't already, I would integrate your contacts into Google contacts, which acts like a backup for your phone's contacts and syncs your Gmail contacts with your phone. Seriously, the best thing about Android is how fluid it is with everything Google - Gmail, maps, Google contacts, and now Google search history with Google Now (on Jelly Bean), so that will be a nice surprise for you. Take some time to play around with it and do some Google searches to really find all the nooks and crannies of your new device. If you have any questions feel free to ask (your post will usually get downvoted but the question will usually get answered well enough). If I left anything out or if you have more questions just let me know!"

It was actually developed at Oxford University in 1980, before then being commercialised by Sony. It has been around a long time, but if you pack a lot of them together they have some nasty thermal problems, which is what has made them so difficult to use in electric vehicles. Other people have tried to get around the problem by trying to reduce manufacturing defects which vastly increases the cost, however Tesla took the other route and devised a thermal management system for the cheap ones. If they hadn't done that, the price of the car would probably be over the hundred grand mark.

1	So basically we need DDR4 ram and we will have the best of both worlds lol	gtmax500	gaming	6	6	0	2013-06	1371172050	DDR3 is the regular RAM you are familiar with in PCs. GDDR5 is currently only used in graphics cards. DDR3 has very low latency compared with GDDR5 and is best at handling lots of small amounts of data, great for a PC where there are many things all happening at once. GDDR5 has more latency, but the RAM will be mounted along with the CPU in an APU. This basically reduces the distance the data has to travel and so reduces this latency. Where GDDR5 really shines though is in speed. It is incredibly fast and can handle huge amounts of data very quickly, this is why it is used in graphics cards. To put the amounts of RAM in the PS4 and Xbox One in context, the top end graphics cards currently available use just 6GB of GDDR5 RAM and cost more than twice the price of the PS4. Whereas you can buy 8GB of DDR3 RAM for about a tenth of the price of the Xbox One. To be fair to the Xbox One, using DDR3 makes sense for them. They are pushing the Xbox One as being for more than just games, and there is constant multitasking going on with the triple layer OS. The PS4 on the other hand has a lot less multitasking and is mostly a games machine. GDDR5 is great for that. This will hopefully (from the point of view of a convert to PS4) mean the PS4 has absolutely insane graphics capabilities and is also somewhat future proofed vs PCs for several years. tl;dr: as far as I can understand the PS4 is basically an insanely powerful (and cheap) graphics card.

1	Damn commie.	OpenUsername	TalesFromRetail	2	2	0	2013-04	1367360053	Fellow retailers, what is the strangest thing you have been called by a costumer? First time poster long time lurker. Recently I have started a job at a giant shoe warehouse, my duties consist of backing up register when we get busy, organizing shoes and boxes, cleaning shoe messes, and helping costumers. While I love my job, my coworkers, and my managers I have dealt with some weird people and heard a lot of weird things in the short time I have worked there. One day this older gentleman, we will call him OG, walked in and went to the back of our store where are boots are located for men. The conversation went like this: Me: Hello sir, anything I can help you with? OG: Yea, do you have any shoes made in America? While this is a question I had yet to here during my time working, I knew the answer was no. Me: Sorry sir, we don't have any shoes made here in the states. Most of them are made in China. However, we do have shoes made in India, Italy, and Argentina. OG: Oh, well I am looking to only spend $40, can you show me where those shoes are? Oh boy. Me: Well sir, those shoes are going to be around $80-$100. All the ones for $40 are going to be made in China. OG: Oh really? Well damn, you guys support the Chinese... You guys are communists. Me: *stunned* well.. I can still show you the not made in China shoes. OG: Don't worry about it. Thanks for the help. I will just look around. It was there I apologized and said if he needed anything to come find me. I then went an had a good laugh with some co-workers. The Old Gentleman was probably teasing and he was very nice. The communist jab just caught me off guard. So fellow retailers what is the strangest thing that you have been called by a customer? I could use a good laugh!

Consequently the human body core temperature is ~98.6 degrees and 100 marks a fever. Also Fahrenheit is more useful in weather where 90-100&lt; is a really hot day and &lt;0-32 (sometimes a little higher depending on the atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) mark possible snow/ice conditions. So IMO, Fahrenheit is perfect for everyday things and Celsius is perfect for cooking and in the lab (although Kelvin is more relevant there).

Firstly, and I'm pretty sure it's no surprise, I call myself a feminist. The way I view sayings such as ""patriarchy hurts everyone"" is that it's oppressive to both men and women. For the sake of an example, let's take traditional gender roles - men as breadwinners and women as carers. Patriarchy hurts for those men who would like to be stay at home dads or house husbands, or perhaps more importantly, who want to have access to paternal leave, or who want to have primary or full custody of their children. That's the feminism I believe in and fight for, anyway. One that brings all genders to equality."

The other night I was scared to look through someone's desk for something because they ""might have cameras"" somewhere. Logical me immediately called me stupid for that one. I refuse to drive after I've had even one drink because I'm scared of an over zealous cop pulling me over and giving me a DUI. Sometimes..... I'm even hesitant to think negative thoughts about someone in front of them.... Because WHAT IF they can read minds? When this happens I usually immediately start thinking in my head as if they can read minds; shit-talking them or thinking about how I know they're telepathic.

You state that 'You didn't insult them personally' but then immediately say you think they're 'brainwashed' as if it's completely unreasonable that someone put their faith into Mormonism of their own free will. Just re-read what you put and ask if it was 'civil' like calling their rules 'stupid' or giving them a 'Godspeed'. It seems like you took time out of your day to be cruel to these guys opposed to sit down and discuss their theology and try to understand them, you berate them on the negative aspects of their religion, and mock them on their way. You obviously don't have to defend yourself. But, to me, it seems like you were just being a dick opposed providing anything of benefit or value to your or their lives.

Ares himself doesn't have a lot of killing power alone unless someone makes a mistake (and gets pulled into a tower) like Sobek. His ulti will be really strong though and will help finish kills even when he's not pulling someone into a tower or ulti combo. It has crazy long range it seems which means it can negate a lot of escapes. Also, you can move while you have it activated so it looks like the pull distance is huge. Positioning is everything in MOBAs and smite is no different really. Bottom line is that Aegis/Beads are going to be even more of a must-have with Ares in the game.

There's absolutely no rationing of care in the NHS, in fact BUPA actually move their patients to NHS hospitals when they no longer have to cover them. Often caused by certain surgeries or treatments not being profitable enough for them. And again there are Americans who come to the UK for treatment because what they pay in the UK for treatment even as a non-citizen is cheaper than the rates in the US. Many foreigners get worried about the bills they'll face from treatment in UK hospitals and are shocked at how little they are actually charged. I can tell you why BUPA is popular though, it's used as a ""benefit"" for employee packages. Pretty much like a luxury that no one truly needs but it'll make you go with one employer over the other. In fact my uncle had BUPA care all of his life through his employer but where did he go for treatment? The NHS run hospitals and practices."

Sometimes the flagstand defense is ridiculous (e.g. two DMBs, a RDR, a PTH, and a SEN) and requires a concerted effort to take down. If it's late game, the base assets are MK4 untouchables, and a shrike is camping the stand, it can take an act of God to clear it - I've had more luck stacking cappers and praying one breaks through. Other times, half the enemy team is playing [VDG] or the two to four people on the stand are fairly weak, and it's relatively simple to keep it clear single-handedly. Nothing is more satisfying than hearing summer break pubbers whining about an overpowered enemy (i.e. a single SLD with AR/Thumper).

Natanael_L	technology	0	0	0	2013-02	1362006860	"I think the backlash has more to do with the idea that Samsung doesn't even try when it comes to stuff like this. There's only so many ways to skin a cat, but Samsung does seem to enjoy doing it in a very similar way to Apple. It gets a little old when people say, ""But that's just obvious! Of course it's going to look that way!"" Every. Single. Time. Let's look at laptops, for instance. Apple comes out with the wedge-shaped MacBook Air - a great machine that shows technology had caught up with the design concept from 2008. Intel launches Ultrabooks to ship more ULV processors, and suddenly the only way you can design a laptop is to look more or less identical to the Apple version. Cue everyone saying that it's ""just obvious"". Same goes for expensive workstation laptops too. Now the only way to ""obviously"" make one is to ape the MacBook Pro. In a bunch of different ways, all the way through product categories and implementations, Apple does something clever and popular, then everyone else has a shot at ripping it off but there's nary a peep about it. No, it's Apple who ""needs to innovate"" or ""needs to bring out the next big thing"". They *did innovate*, they did *bring out the next big thing*. They also sold a *fuckton*, which is why the new standard is whatever Apple does. The aggravation for me is that the discourse immediately refuses to acknowledge anything Apple does to move things forward for no other reason than people *don't like them*. It has no basis in fact, just a general dislike. It's stupid and lowers the level of conversation to moronic levels, and as a result our sources of news will flamebait because that's what drives clicks."

Biffingston	conspiratard	1	1	0	2013-10	1382109135	The only semi-valid response to this I've heard is the argument that Obama and the Democrats should have negotiated sooner once the shutdown had begun. Honestly though, letting the Tea Party twist in the wind as they did is something that'll be good for the country in the long run and should have happened years ago. Of course there's also the fact that the Senate tried something like 19 times to open budget negotiations and was shot down by the House that sort of ruins that narrative.

The most difference between a round of the same design (for example, JHP) with any grain, in the following calibers: 9mm, .357 sig, .45, is less than or equal to 100fps. Interestingly enough, .40S&amp;W had larger differences - sometimes 300fps more...(I'm guessing that website tests average maximum velocity, although it doesn't explicitly state that.) Now, I'm not a doctor, so I don't know for sure if a projectile traveling 1200fps would do more damage to bone and tissue than a projectile traveling 1100 fps, but having used a handgun to engage the enemy in the military and having used a handgun to engage armed criminals, my assumption is the extra 100fps is only going to matter when you're engaging a vehicle, wall, or a bulletproof vest - all things that other factors would come into play as well (type of bullet, type of target, etc). But even then, I don't believe 100fps more is going to matter.

Some months I get paid later in the month, so I have to cancel the auto payment and pay with a check. That makes it a little interesting as my landlord can take over a week sometimes to cash the damned check.

Live free, when the mortgage is paid off, the rent is retirement money. Of course, if it is fucked in your area, that might be a buy opportunity. You might get the building all-paid-for for $80K.

It was also illegal in those states. Though it was something of a common rumor that got bandied about by the staff. I echo what others have said: (1) check with your state labor authorities and (2) start looking for another job. The worst case scenario woud have you filing a claim. And filing a claim can be laborious and might not come out the way that you intended. Also, bad managers really aren't worth it and contrary to popular belief, they are the exception. Good managers have always been more or less the norm for me. Luckily, bad managers often show their true colors through policies like this long before they actually mess you over. Take this policy as a warning that you are working for a knucklehead and begin plotting your strategy to move on.

No carcinogens, just water vapor and nicotine (which in itself is harmless (though,, of course, addictive)).

Yeah, life may have been a little harder than ordinary for them too from 18-25, but that was a minor inconvenience that could be cast aside through hard work, determination, etc. Why can't every ordinary citizen just do the same?

1	You are worse than 1000 Hitlers	ForgedIronMadeIt	sanfrancisco	36	36	0	2013-12	1386637572	I live in the sunset and work for genentech. I take a corporate shuttle every morning too and from work, so suppose I am part of the problem. Each morning, I leave my rent-controlled apartment and walk the mile or so to the stop for my bus. On the way, I stop into the beanery to pick up a warm steaming cup of coffee before heading up to get my bus. On the way home, I usually stop in somewhere for a beer before either heading to andronicos for some meat, or perhaps to one of the billion restaurants within a few blocks of my house for some food. Aside from rent, i reckon in a week I put in about 3 or 400 into the local economy I am the problem, a transplant that came to the bay area for a better job than the one I had. I can afford to pay a ridiculous amount of rent even though my rent is pretty much equal to my monthly salary in my old job. My wife is a social worker over on the east bay and commutes every day 1 hour to get to Richmond where she works with kids in school. I've lived here for a year and love it. Because I take a corporate shuttle, does it mean I'm a bad person? I moved for the opportunities that the bay area provides. Hitting out at people going to work accomplishes nothing. I understand they want affordable housing, I would LOVE to pay less than I am. However, I am 31 and South San Francisco has nothing of interest for me. If it didn't mean me having to go right across town on the N before hitting the CALTRAIN to SSF, I would take public transit as it's something i agree strongly with. However, because of the inefficient transit for anyone heading anywhere else except downtown or the east bay, it just isn't feasible

He had a pretty terrible game lots of giveaways and didn't look that great. I'm unsure if this was because of the pressure, those added defensive responsibilities, or because he was playing with Smyth. We'll see this Saturday in the second game and last game before RNH returns. But I'd rather see him back on LW. He's one of the best LWs in the league and he should really just focus on that.

0	I got the aromatherapy lotion the other day and it is definitely worth the $5 I had to pay.	wiiildflower	freebies	2	2	0	2013-12	1387807080	Just a heads up, if you give Bath and Body Works a landline phone number when you check out, the company can send you awesome coupons through mail. They send out $10 off a purchase of $30, 20% off, and free item coupons all the time. Same thing for giving an email, which you can also sign up for online. They also slip $10off$30s and some other random coupons in your bag when you check out. Durning Dec. the company features a new deal daily. They actually just had the aromatherapy body lotions on sale for $5 (which is not free, but is still an awesome deal) and the craziest deal of the day was probably the $8 3-wick candles, down from $20. Also, the Semi-Annual sale is starting on the 26th and prices are about to hit rock bottom. Anyway, **TL;DR**: You should never pay full price at Bath and Body Works, they are constantly giving coupons away and are usually running amazing in store promotions that can be combined with your coupons.

Of course I've read many more books than these (3 on the go at once right now), but these are the ones that really stand out. *Johnathan Livingston Seagull,* and *Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah* by Richard Bach *Stranger in a Strange Land* by Robert Heinlein *Everything* by Frank Herbert *Siddhartha*, by Hermann Hesse Also, texts from most of the major religions and philosophers such as Lao Tzu and Plato.

1	What you're gonna wanna do is hit your ball so it curves slightly left.	kurosevic	golf	0	0	0	2013-12	1387344875	best way to draw ? Hello :) I would like to know your take on the best/easiest/most consistent way to hit a push-draw (ball starting right of the target and then coming back towards the target). I've been experimenting with this for a couple of sessions. * My approach on it is (i am a righthander) : set up with my stance right of target line, then set up my clubface about half way between my stance line and the target line (which means the clubface is open to the target, but closed to the path line). * When doing this, at adress, should my shoulders be square to the target line or should they be square to my stance line ? * If i want to do this using a long iron (2, 3 or 4), should i still position the ball more towards my left heel ? Because when i'm hitting a standard straight shot with a long iron, that's what i usually do (don't know if it's needed or not necessary ?) Thank you for your insight =)
0	Apparently Final Fantasy games have this effect	rhapsodicink	Games	1	1	0	2012-07	1342653072	Games on steam that have the perfect mixture of story, music and characters to leave an emotional impact? Im getting bored of playing racing games and action shooters that are fun but are incredibly forgettable. I want something more out of my games. Games that give me chills and almost cry. That make me think about the story after I beat the game or make me feel different emotions throughout the whole play through. Examples of games that have done this to me are **Bioshock, Mass Effect series, Dear Esther, and oddly enough, Halo,** to name a few of my favourites. Any others out there? Preferably on steam since this is my main gaming platform.

I don't need to ""recover"" from liking opiates, I just need to properly moderate myself. But that's a whole other topic for another day. Drugs are great when used properly. Am I more likely to use drugs to cope with stress than I am to use them in a purely recreational way if I'm extremely stressed? Definitely. Am I more likely to be stressed under Capitalism than Communism? Definitely. But that doesn't mean Capitalism causes drug use. Even if when I'm relatively stress free, I will take drugs. They feel good and enhance all sorts of experiences. Opitates for pure, independent of everything bliss. Stimulants for increasing the enjoyment of activities you already enjoy. Alcohol for socializing and relaxing after a hard day. Psychedelics to blow your mind out into the universe while simultaneously reminding you of the utter beauty in the simplest of things, creating an overall more positive worldview. Disassociatives for adventurous folk who want to see just how fucking weird consciousness can get. Even without external stressors, drugs properly used can enhance your life and it's totally normal for people to desire these experiences."

I posted this on AskWomen and someone recommended I post it here. I'm a single, 40 year old father with two beautiful daughters. My oldest is eleven and my youngest is six. I've been a widower for the past three years and it's been hard, especially as my eldest approaches her adolescence. I thought I had at least a couple of years before I had to worry about her getting her period, but this afternoon she approached me and embarrassingly told me she started. I already bought her a book about puberty and as soon as she told me she hit her period I went out and bought some pads. I flipped through the book and it addressed how to work a pad, but I don't think that'll be enough. What about tampons? How old should she be before she starts to use them? What should she do when she gets blood on her clothes? Throw them out? Wash them? I'm so ignorant on this kind of stuff and I don't know where to start learning. We live far away from family and I don't have any close female coworkers to come and talk to her. How do I go about this? Should I put her on the phone with her aunt? She needs female guidance, but sadly there's no one physically near. I really want to handle this well and try to make her as unembarrassed as possible, but I'm lost. What should I say to her? What kind of questions will she ask? I've never talked to her about sex. Should I? Should I bring up her changing body and hormones? I'm so terrified she won't get the education she needs and deserves. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Just try to be more optimistic when you listen to the new tracks. This song was tight as fuck with some clutter in the production but regardless it still works out nice. And to be honest, overall I'm just glad Em is back.

I'd expect that over the course of the next 2-3 years that content will be gradually added to D3 that will make it worthwhile to have, but the value just isn't there yet. I've put about 80 hours into D3, but only about 30 I'd say were all that fun. The rest was frustrating, boring grinding while I looked for the fun, which just wasn't there. I'd recommend seeing if D3 goes on sale for cheap within the next year and save your money for the Steam sale.

0	It seems like you just come here to winge about diablo 3 more than talk about Day Z	Kar98	dayz	1	1	0	2012-07	1342144643	Diablo 3 is a perfect example of what the gaming industry has done to games. Look at Diablo 1. Look at the structure. What happened when you died? All your items popped off your body and you had to go get them. You also lost experience, and not a little, but a lot. It was hardcore. Then Diablo 2. Ok no more items falling off corpse when you die, but there is experience loss at least. You still lost a fair amount when you died as well, and you still had to go back to loot your corpse of items. Now we have Diablo 3. No items fall off body upon death, no experience loss. Auction house so you dont even need to farm. Real life Money Auction house so you dont even need in game gold. By the way you keep all items upon death. Do you see how watered down this has become!? Where is the risk vs reward in diablo 3? Tell me. Seriously Diablo 3 is a joke. It represents what gaming has become. Video games used to be made by people who wanted others to have a great experience playing their vision. Now its made by a guy in a suit sitting in a desk on floor 201 who looks at nothing more than production charts. Thats how we got Diablo 3, and it is the biggest piece of shit thats come a long in a while. Its made by a billion dollar company who decided squeezing out a few more dimes was worth more than integrity and a good product.

The *belief* by journalists that this is happening is enough to have a chilling effect on authority-challenging reporting. Saying that these journalists' belief that they're being monitored is unjustified doesn't address the fact that belief doesn't require 100% certainty; and after noticing that every single large-scale whistleblower is caught and punished, that belief seems justified even if it can't be proved. So: does anyone not believe that all journalists are closely monitored? And what does that wide-spread belief imply about what journalists are (and most importantly are not) willing to report?

First off, yes, this is of course a thing, but no one here really has hit on why this happens. First off, studios do *not* steal movies from creatives. Ever since Buckwald v. Paramount studios have been careful as hell about not doing this (It's one of the many reasons producers, production companies and studios alike do not take unsolicited scripts). Hollywood is much more connected than people realize. Decision makers at studios tend to swim in the same circles and there actually is an ounce of truth to some of what goes on in Entourage (espionage and whatnot). The most common scenarios are: 1) You have Studio A that hears that Studio B has decided to put War Movie A into production. Decision makers at Studio A don't want to get in trouble for missing out on making money on a product that Studio B saw a financial opportunity to make. So Studio A fast tracks a production in the same genre from their reserve of optioned scripts that are stuck in development hell. They hire actors that test well to the same markets that the actors in Studio B cast and put the movie into production with a cheap director, cheap DP and the cheap production crews they tend to hire (and is the reason they get hired for crapfests such as these). 2) Studio A and Studio B both get their marketing data from the same Hollywood marketing company (the biggest of which is Inphenate which all the studios use so this happens a lot). They both look for scripts in their option library (for those that don't know, a script that has been 'optioned' is a script the studio paid the writer money for, usually at a reduced cost, and promises the writer certain dividends should the movie go into production which it almost never does (which is called being 'shelved')). So both studios either find those scripts in their option library or they don't and find a cost-effective writing/producing team to produce it (and on rare occasions actually find a writer who has made exactly what they're looking for). Both studios then go into production. The two studios then find out that they're both producing the same type of movie and both order the movies the to be fast-tracked to try and beat the other. This leads to them grabbing the next earliest release window in theaters, which are usually right next to each other. However, to get those fast-tracked early release windows they also have to find lower-cost talent that are still recognizable that are *also* available for the shooting window which usually leads to smaller shooting windows for the talent and hurried production schedules for the production team. This further lowers the quality of the film. So everything gets rushed out into theaters and usually the first film to market makes the majority of the money and the second film gets the scraps and whoever failed to secure the earlier release window gets fired and the person who worked under them takes their position and Daily Variety barely even covers it because that's how business is done in town. 3) Both studios just happened to be producing similar films because the concepts are nebulous and the timing felt right because they're trying to secure a relationship with the production crew/talent involved with the production or the other myriad reasons that films get made for seemingly no reason whatsoever. Then mostly what happens in Scenario 2 takes over. It can sound disheartening, but once you realize that studios are simply responding to how Americans watch movies then you realize it's really just the fault of the people who go to the movies that the system became what it is now. This sucks for creatives on the screenwriting side of things, but if you know the system then you can sell yourself for rewrite work by getting into popular genres that are hitting with the studios which can be pretty decent money. Plus, if you can get on a short-list of rewriters you're pretty much set while you work on trying to get a screenplay sold.
0	The last 4 numbers?	PrebirthHipster	pics	32	32	0	2013-05	1369676748	a good trick to start using is to use your thumb for any numbers above 3 (or below, if you're looking at the grid.) With one hand covering your fingers, your thumb can move freely without being visible. Also, use the erase feature if you're really worried. Type in 4 digits, erase, then put in your pin.

A friend marched me into the Spurs bar and said: ""this is your team."" It wasn't until I heard the supporters sing that I knew I was hooked. I can't explain it, really. Afterwards, I attributed it to much of what the article spoke about: beautiful football, underdog status, etc. And yet, there's something about Spurs supporters that drew me right in, unlike any other supporters anywhere in any sport. Sounds trite I know, but it's the truth."

0	This is a great explanation and thanks for clarifying even without the sex.	unnecessar	AskWomen	2	2	0	2013-09	1380225345	Fuck buddy - An acquaintance that you have regular sex with. The primary reason for your relationship is sex. You spend time together for the purpose of sex. Friend with benefits - A friend that you have regular sex with. The primary reason for your relationship is friendship, but you enjoy the benefits of additionally having a sexual relationship with each other. You spend time together because you enjoy each other's company, regardless of if you have sex. Relationship - A romantic partner. You have stronger-than-friend feelings for one another, and generally the hope/goal that the relationship will progress into something long-term and serious (I say generally because it is possible to want a short-term relationship, e.g. if you know you'll be moving to another country in a few months). While most relationships include sex, sex isn't necessary for something to be considered a relationship (e.g. a couple waiting for marriage is still in a relationship, despite the fact that they are not having sex with each other). Monogamy is a separate issue. It's possible to have non-monogamous relationships (i.e. open or poly relationships). On the other hand, you and your FWB could decide you want to be monogamous with each other (perhaps to avoid sexual jealousy or out of concern for STDs).

But piracy is complicated. Let's say I buy some of Hank Rearden's metal. I pay for it, and the transaction is just. Objectivism would obviously see no flaw in my then deciding to give the metal to a friend, if I freely choose to depart with it. Now, what if I, by studying the metal, were instead to figure out how to reproduce it? And then give some of the reproduced product to a friend? This is obviously the crux of the piracy issue, and by the above reasoning, I'd have to conclude that it would be unjust. But that leaves one with a strange problem: how can a moral law allow me to own something, but not to depart with it? I'm pretty sure there's an answer. Just looking for some perspective.

They tend to have either good or bad batches with computers. We had the first E-series laptops for a client, and I thought I would go insane. Going from the indestructible D630 to that flimsy plastic junk first edition E6400, was just not a good couple of months. So it is no surprise if you got a bad batch, especially after they moved the production to china. That said, all in all, we had several thousands of Dell laptops go through the company, and out to clients. And in general they did what they was suppose to do. But there is no getting around that the E-series did generate a lot more work/problems then the old tank D-series.

I tried googling it but the best I found was an article from last month about a group pushing for medical in Georgia but I haven't heard anything about full legalization being even a teensy bit of a possibility in Georgia. Honestly though, I think Georgia will be the first state in the South to legalize. Atlanta is a very progressive city for the South. I moved from Colorado, and I was expecting everyone in Georgia to be very against weed. Nope. Not at all. I know very few people here who don't smoke. Among younger generations, people seem to have the exact same opinions on weed here as in Colorado (besides some conservative extremists but they are the minority and I met them in Colorado too). Anyways, hope this is true, it would truly be awesome. Georgia is a beautiful state and it would be even cooler if us stoners didn't have to be paranoid while enjoying it. :) :P

There's a lot of leeway in regards to where a runner can be when another player isn't in the process of trying to get him out. He can take a wide turn around first and make a circle around the bases if he likes. But once the runner is attempting to beat out a tag, his baseline is narrowed to the space between him and the bases, with about a 3-foot buffer to his right and left, so that he can't simply circumvent a fielder.

Reading definitely won't make you a genius by itself, that much is true. But reading even fiction will *perhaps* pique your interest in subjects that you otherwise wouldn't have been interested in, or even heard of. Say you're reading a novel set in a different country than yours, that you've never visited or even heard much of. Then the context of the novel is a social struggle or civil war or what have you, regarding that country. Maybe that sounds interesting and you wiki a little and find out more about it. Then that would make you perhaps look for a book (nonfiction) regarding that subject, which in turn would open up new insights and information that you would've been ignorant about, had it not been for that novel in the first place. I truly think that people who read in general tend to be a little more ""knowledgeable"" about general culture. But again, that's just my opinion."

My happily married, middle aged boss said something to me about men in relationships wanting women that made me think. He said: ""men will always look, but they just choose not to act on it, because they prefer what they have at home"". If what he says is true, then it's not that men don't want other women, they just make a conscious decision to choose monogamy over getting to sleep with multiple women, knowing they only have the choice of one or the other. But my question is, if your wonderful partner, who you love very much, was completely fine and happy with you sleeping with other women on the occasion that you meet one you are attracted to, and society was also supportive of it, would you still choose to be monogamous? So would your ideal world be having your partner (who is monogamous to you) *and* having other women if you want them, OR is your ideal world one where you only ever have the one partner for the rest of your life?"

The average 22 year old age of this sub according to the survey means we are a target for more juvenile BS than some other subs. There are a lot of mature 22 year olds, but most fall apart online. It's a little odd, as F1 has a varied age group. I guess just the fact we are a subreddit keeps many younger folks in here, while most older, more knowledgable, and mature fans generally are not redittors. This is why IMO that when you go to a site like F1technical you get to talk to 'grown ups' in the forums. People are just jacked on F1 and discussing it, not a pissing match while dick measuring at the same time like this place.

What you said was incredibly misleading and disingenuous; over a lifetime nearly 1 in 5 (18%) women have been raped versus 1.4% for men.

However, if you actually end up *hating* the game because of these types of things, then in my opinion you are nit picking and ruining the game for yourself. This is not to say that H4 is devoid of problems, but condemning the entire game experience over a feature like sprint seems really elitist and snobby to me. To add a bit about adapting: even if you don't like or ""hate"" an element of the gameplay (sprint), you do indeed still need to adapt if you want to perform well, unless you successfully lobby to get that element removed (incredibly unlikely). Liking or not liking a feature of gameplay has nothing to do with whether or not you should adapt to it."

1	Always a woman's fault, yup.	thesleepingsoul	gameofthrones	8	8	0	2013-06	1370388872	Just to add a bit of context to this: Yes, Jorah did sell slaves at one point, but it was largely out of desperation. His wife at the time was from a rich family, but after marrying him she moved to Bear Island, which had warriors but not much wealth, and she quickly grew disappointed. Jorah tried to satisfy her with tons of expensive gifts, but it didn't work and he only ended up bankrupting himself and his House/family. So he'd driven himself into debt for this woman, and didn't see a way out of it...but hey, the slave trade in the Free Cities paid a lot, and there were poachers on his island that he had to do *something* with... But of course he got caught, and had to flee to (eventually) Essos before Ned Stark came to execute him. For the record, no, I don't think this bit of backstory justifies selling people into slavery. However, it does makes things more understandable and fitting with his character. Jorah always tries to do too much for the women he loves, and gets screwed over for it.

While you diligently pursued that favorite phantom of yours, called profits, and moralized about that favorite fetish of yours, called competition, even greater and more direful things have been accomplished by combination. There is the militia."" ""It is our strength!"" cried Mr. Kowalt. ""With it we would repel the invasion of the regular army."" ""You would go into the militia yourself,"" was Ernest's retort, ""and be sent to Maine, or Florida, or the Philippines, or anywhere else, to drown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties. While from Kansas, or Wisconsin, or any other state, your own comrades would go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood your own civil-warring."" Now they were really shocked, and they sat wordless, until Mr. Owen murmured: ""We would not go into the militia. That would settle it. We would not be so foolish."" Ernest laughed outright. ""You do not understand the combination that has been effected. You could not help yourself. You would be drafted into the militia."" ""There is such a thing as civil law,"" Mr. Owen insisted. ""Not when the government suspends civil law. In that day when you speak of rising in your strength, your strength would be turned against yourself. Into the militia you would go, willy-nilly. Habeas corpus, I heard some one mutter just now. Instead of habeas corpus you would get post mortems. If you refused to go into the militia, or to obey after you were in, you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down like dogs. It is the law."" ""It is not the law!"" Mr. Calvin asserted positively. ""There is no such law. Young man, you have dreamed all this. Why, you spoke of sending the militia to the Philippines. That is unconstitutional. The Constitution especially states that the militia cannot be sent out of the country."" ""What's the Constitution got to do with it?"" Ernest demanded. ""The courts interpret the Constitution, and the courts, as Mr. Asmunsen agreed, are the creatures of the trusts. Besides, it is as I have said, the law. It has been the law for years, for nine years, gentlemen."" ""That we can be drafted into the militia?"" Mr. Calvin asked incredulously. ""That they can shoot us by drumhead court martial if we refuse?"" ""Yes,"" Ernest answered, ""precisely that."" ""How is it that we have never heard of this law?"" my father asked, and I could see that it was likewise new to him. ""For two reasons,"" Ernest said. ""First, there has been no need to enforce it. If there had, you'd have heard of it soon enough. And secondly, the law was rushed through Congress and the Senate secretly, with practically no discussion. Of course, the newspapers made no mention of it. But we Socialists knew about it. We published it in our papers. But you never read our papers."" -Jack London, The Iron Heel, 1908"

I sent the chief of police and a couple others an email stating how this stereotyped men as the sole perpetrators of this type of action (there was no female accusing male point).

For one, most kids these days aren't typical movie bullies that just love beating smaller kids up for no reason, some are just annoying fucks that don't even know the damage their doing to someone In addition to that, if this kid was a real scumbag bully who was just out to hurt your son, he's probably got some real psychological problems from probably being abused at home. It's good for your son to stand up for himself, and I'm not defending the bully, but solving problems with violence is not going to make things better, maybe for your son but that bully will still target others

But with emergent tech like this, I'm just going to wait a few iterations.

0	The point about fear becomes especially interesting when you consider approaches to categorzing sexuality like the Kinsey scale or the Klein Grid, that show human sexuality as a sliding scale based on various influences, because it means that oftentimes those who are so driven by fear are at some point on the scale and recognize it in themselves.	suddenfuture	TrueAtheism	6	6	0	2013-02	1361764152	"There are a few reasons why homosexuality is still a hot topic among the faithful. First, and I'll start at the most malevolent of the reasons, is that a small portion of the population is easy to pick on, especially when even those people have been raised to believe that their sexual preference is ""wrong"". A tragic misfortune of the human psyche is that the easiest way to unite people is with a common enemy, whether that enemy be real or imagined. Second, as _pH_ aptly pointed out, it is difficult for a heterosexual man to empathize with the homosexual mindset. ""How can you not be attracted to a beautiful woman, when that's sometimes all that *I* think about?"" This is reinforced by the notion that looking at another man sexually is to be considered repulsive. Which brings me to my third reason: Fear of their own possible homosexuality, or at least curiosity. This is not to say that homophobes are *all* actually homosexual, but there is a contingent of gay-haters that are outwardly homophobic in an effort to mask their own insecurities. The final ingredient is confirmation bias, gleefully provided by their respective religions. This is the justification for their hatred. After all, like the WBC repeats so often, ""*WE* don't hate fags, *God* does"". You are correct that there is a whole slew of OT laws and commandments regularly ignored by Christianity. Welcome to Religion 101."

Having read through the blatant racist generalizations prevalent throughout this thread, I can honestly say that I've never been more ashamed to be human. It's absolutely ridiculous. Criminality is a problem across the board, it doesn't originate with the Romany community, not to mention the disregard concerning the *two different cultures* of Irish Travellers and Gypsies. If this lumping together had happened with two other ethnic groups, you wouldn't be able to breathe on this forum for cries of RACIST! A small minority of *either* Irish Travellers or Gypsies give both communities a bad name and here I am seeing it used as justification for Ethnic Cleansing?!?! Are you bloody kidding me?! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Did it give you no pause to type such hatred and spew such unadulterated bile? Because, let me tell you, it's given me plenty of pause and the conclusion I'm sliding towards is this; do I really want to be part of a community that, having previously prided itself on the open-mindedness of its patrons can so easily and unashamedly brush that aside in favour of this hate fuelled rhetoric? What an eye-opener.

It wasn't because the public was complacent, it was because the public was desperate, there was that whole economic meltdown at play. You can look up Nazi approval ratings back in 1929 right before the great depression, they were in the single digits, in 1934 Nazis had majority rule, that's not a coincidence. Desperation (financial or otherwise) breeds extremism, with the current economic crisis its more important than ever to acknowledge that link, rather than pass off the 3rd Reich as being a once-off thing that could never happen again. It absolutely could happen again, and we need to know the symptoms to be able to prepare.

Should I, as a man take a unlit street to my house when walking home, simply because if I take the lit street, I'll be continuing to follow a dainty, white gloved flower of a woman ahead of me? Should I, as a man, Take the stairs to my 8th floor not ""walk up"", or wait the 8 minutes for the painfully slow elevator to return, as to not inconvenience my neighbor? Should I, as a man, stand well behind a woman in line at the grocery, especially if she is wearing a dress or skirt, so as not to appear a creep, despite the impact to the rest of the shoppers and flow around the store?

I am aware I am not well-versed in *practical* politics so much as political philosophy, but I do know a president of the US can be impeached for treason, bribery, etc. So why not the numerous offenses against the Constitution carried out by Obama during his term? Is his murder of American citizens not an impeachable crime? Does the VP become president in such a case, and if so is that why there's no real movement to impeach? I can understand that, I suppose, because Biden is useless except as assassination insurance for Barack. Please help me understand why the American people cannot peaceably depose the corrupt traitor currently in the White House for a person who will at very least respect the basic tenets of the Constitution.

Also, the most belligerently drunk/loud groups I've met are typically from the UK or Australia, in my experience, even though we have the reputation for it. I have had a few problems, but not nearly as many as you'd think. Some people in Innsbruck and Berlin clearly did not like me. People in Northern Vietnam hated all Westerners, in Southern Vietnam they liked the fact I was American. Many still pride themselves on fighting for the Southern army. I have had a Dutch and German guy (on separate occasions) tell me they was reluctant to hang out with my group because they assumed we would be ""arrogant assholes"" after they learned we were American. I asked them what they were basing this on and they said they were basing it on the stereotype. The German guy came to the US and loved the people, and is now completing college here. I have had a few other issues here and there. In Thailand a bus company went through my bag and stole something, so I was filling out a police report. They had my passport out to fill out the paper work. This very wound up chick came in who was just pickpocketed and lost her passport, all her money, bank cards, etc. I tried to make friendly conversation to calm her down and she was kind of stand offish (which I admit could have had more to do with what just happened and not my nationality). Their phones would not make international calls, so I let her use my phone to try and get a hold of her dad in Switzerland and her mom in France. She could not reach them to have them wire her money, so I offered her 500 Bhat (US$16) to get her by until she could reach her parents. She started crying and asked me why I was being so nice to a stranger. Not sure if she assumed I would be an arrogant asshole because of my nationality or was just caught off guard. I felt kind of bad she was so surprised someone was being nice to her. Guess its just a stereotype me and you will just have to deal with when we travel abroad. I try to fight it one person at a time."

It's easy to be a little whining bitch, sitting in front of your computer, talking about the fact you don't have anyone. If you were *that* concerned about it, you'd be getting out there joining a club or getting fit or trying to make an effort with other people. The truth is, you'd much rather sit at home writing sarcastic comments on Reddit than ever find someone else. Sure, you occasionally think ""I'd like to have someone"" but then you inevitably go jerk off and forget that notion. Well, until you feel the need to tell some online strangers at any rate. Go do something about it or shut the fuck up. Unless you're in solitary confinement there's no reason why you cannot go and meet someone nice."

1	But that would mean buying things... ;-;	hayden0103	technology	1	1	0	2012-06	1340895971	question: is anybody here not all that bothered by this? These measures, by definition, are only going to be in place to deter piracy. I feel like it shouldn't be that controversial a statement to say that stealing is bad. I'm against CISPA because of how easily it can be reinterpreted to attack pretty much anything, but I feel like a measure that is only in place to stop piracy is more or less like a shoplifting alarm on the internet. Now, I'm sure that plenty of people will downvote and tell me that this is just a short step from policing everything, and that they can use the infrastructure to start doing different things, but we can't call evil until somebody actually does some evil. There's a reason that the slippery slope is one of the most basic logical fallacies. In fact, the actual measures being taken don't make any mention of actual monitoring, only a plan to punish people who are pirating. I'm all for privacy, but the fact is that people have somehow gotten to the point where we as a community believe that taking whatever we want is our God-given right and that any measures taken to prevent that are big brother and the thought police grinding their boot into our collective face. TL;DR this actually seems to be a fairly effective and limited measure that could hinder piracy without getting into evil territory.

This doesn't even fully encompass the amount of total religions when considering dead/past/defunct/unknown religions as well. What I'm getting at is if there are 20 primary faiths, and assuming that one (if any) religion was true, Christianity would only have a 5% chance of being the one true religion. Furthermore, the percentage drastically decreases when considering the thousands of offshoots mentioned before to far below the 1% mark. What makes Christianity any more credible than the alternatives? Please do not use the ""because the Bible says it's true"" argument, I'd like a well thought out personal perspective that doesn't involve scripture from a book that can not be proven as factual.

But doing something that leads to his fall, and an ultimate installment of a more radical, militant Muslim Brotherhood type government will be worse. See current Egypt. The ""Arab Spring"" has produced a less stable area. Like Afghanistan and Pakistan, our Military Industrial Complex can't wait to reap the billions in defense contracts. President Eisenhower was right. Very right indeed. Additionally, Russia supports the Assad regime in Syria, and if we stick our noses in, it will be, in essence, a proxy war with the Soviets.

If we look to games from one year ago this month, both The Darkness II and Prototype 2 are $15-$18 new on Amazon, depending on if you want PS3 or 360. That's their normal price. Currently not on sale on Steam, The Darkness 2 is $30, and Prototype 2 is $40. Just examples, and I understand that Steam sales are comprehensive, but the idea that console games never dip in price, or do so very slowly, doesn't really hold a lot of water. Outside of Steam sales, they actually tend to drop in price faster.

WoollyMittens	atheism	1	1	0	2012-08	1344197504	"The Mars Rover And Its Mission So we're merely hours away from the landing of the Mars rover ""Curiosity."" The main objectives of it's mission is to find evidence of life, or at least evidence of previously habitable ancient environments. I think it's safe to say that the most we can hope for is evidence of life in the form of bacteria originating on Mars, but this is still life none the less, and should we make any significant discovery of the kind, I can't help but speculate what this would mean for religion and atheism. Most religions tend to boast that all life was created by god(s) and that it's special because it's only found on Earth, among other reasons. It would be understandable to claim the discovery of other life forms as further proof of the inaccuracy of religion and arguments for believing in god, but of course we could expect religion to somehow tailor their teachings and beliefs to incorporate the existence of life on other planets, should it be discovered. I suppose what I'm asking is, what do you think general response from the religious world will be if sufficient evidence for life is discovered, and how significant would the discovery be to us as atheists?"

The 'war on terror' is one of asymmetrical warfare - typically, it's consisted of terrorists attacking innocent civilians instead of military targets. This obviously leads to really bad PR for the terrorists - pretty much the entire civilized world has united against these guys. It sounds like someone had the bright idea to target off-duty soldiers instead of civilians. It makes moral sense in a fucked-up way. They're going for combatants instead of non-combatants. Beheading and stabbing off-duty soldiers is a dick way to fight a war, of course, but that's why they call it asymmetrical warfare - it's not like they have anti-aircraft batteries to take out the drones that are bombing their people. From their perspective they're fighting a war in the only way they can. Dumb bastards never saw War Games and got the message that the only way to win is not to play...

Not to mention we have him to thank for wireless communication, which is one of the most important tools in modern society. Jonas Salk is awesome, but Tesla's contribution to humanity is also seriously underrated.

I suppose this is a pretty harmless place to get it, but the fact that your ego still feels you deserve support in this after you failed, many times in succession, to resolve a relatively minor altercation is very troubling. You're using the baby as a sacred cow, anything done in the name of which is beyond reproach. Even being rude, or impatient, or sanctimonious, or a jerk, all of which you were. You didn't do what you and your wife agreed on. You defended your actions instead of apologizing. I know it was just some stupid bananas, but maybe it makes your wife less anxious about something she has never done before working out well if she believes she's following some research. Whoever was right, you should apologize. Stop worrying about her, worry about how you conduct yourself.

I think the setting of that time is really important to consider. While black people, stemming from generations of being ""American"", only recently got the chance to establish themselves, immigrants who had at least some money and enjoyed some education back in their homecountries for some generations had more means to find a foothold at the job market and could already send children to school. Black slaves in America didn't have a compensation at that time and they usually dependet on their children helping them out with work at a very young age, just to survive. This was probably carried over many generations in one way or another, with many of these children having the choice between working low wage or being criminal. I really hope that this vicious circle can be broken in future generations. I strongly agree with the point you made. But it also kind of shows that it isn't really the fault of those people being black, doesn't it? It's just that they are a group of people who didn't have the same chance as anybody else."

If you did your best and didn't give up then you can be proud of yourself. - Never hit a woman. - A firm handshake makes a lasting impression. - People like talking about themselves. If you want someone to like you then ask them questions that encourage them to talk about themselves. Afterwards, they'll think it was a great conversation and that you are a great conversationalist. - Money does not equate happiness. Money comes and goes. Money may make things a little easier, but the more money the more problems. - You are about as happy as you make your mind up to be. - Dad says, "" Are you bleeding?"" Me, ""no."" Dad, ""Then stop crying."" - Don't bitch about what you have to do, just do it. - Never bring a knife to a gun fight. ( basically just always be prepared.) - There are no rules in fighting. There is no chivalry in a street fight. There is a not a winner or loser. All that matters is that you stay alive. - Life is not fair. Don't expect anything to be for free. - ""Never underestimate the greed of the other guy"" -Scarface quote, but dad talked about it too. - learn a trade that involves working with your hands. you'll always have something to fall back on. (cars always need fixing, houses always need to be repaired, someone has to make the sandwiches, etc.) - life has ups and downs. enjoy the good times, endure the bad. but guess what? it'll get better again.

Men are leaving in droves and the women are resorting to prostitution clubs to get the 'boyfriend' experience.

What the Japanese government should really do is grow a fucking backbone and tell these women to be more feminine and stop importing American tv shows.

Most of them will grumble a little but still welcome you into their life if you are gay, Catholic, Mormon, Buddhist, even Muslim. But if you are an Atheist expect to be hounded relentlessly, constantly preached to and have little religious gifts left in your office, on your car, and at your front door. You will be fired outright or creatively fired in a way that you can't sue for. You can be denied the ability to teach in a public school. Your property WILL be vandalized and you WILL get threatened by the police when you report it. Some parents will openly point you out to their children and tell them to stay away from you because you are one of Satan's minion (no joke, happened while I was working in the front yard).

0	they downvoted you because you're 15	atheos	reddit.com	2	2	0	2011-08	1313087542	"A downvote question. So yesterday there was a Hillary Duff pic post and I commented ""Damn, she's almost as hot as my girlfriend."" The comment was somewhat in jest. But truth be told, my first thought when I saw the pic was ""Damn. She's almost as hot as my girlfriend."" A storm of downvotes ensue. Why? Am I coming off as braggart? Is the first rule of hot girlfriend: don't talk about hot girlfriend? Or is Hillary Duff a really touchy subject for some folks? Don't get me wrong, I am in no way butt hurt about it. But whenever I see a benign and/or non-offensive comment get downvoted, I always wonder: why?"
1	Another benefit to a one world government is that finally one person can own an entire world, think how amazing that would be!	PlayerDeus	changemyview	1	1	0	2013-12	1388300796	"A united world (""A world order"") isn't as bad as people believe it to be. CMV This is open to interpretation as to what type of system will be put in place, but let's pretend the system that will be put in place is the one I will describe here. I'm fully aware that theory and reality is different. **TL;DR A united world in my opinion is the next step towards a better humanity. A united economy and wealth distribution would lead to faster development of poorer areas, and the policing will be easier with the law being global. The healtecare would be also be global, and the educational system will also be free. I'll expand on each later on.** There will be a main body, that consists of a representative from each country (A congress) and each will have the same voting rights. (This is actually pretty complex and will need some immense amounts of thinking to make it fair towards countries with a bigger population not dominating or having too little power compared to their populace) Corruption will be dealt by a transparent body that will ensure that everything is actually in order. This body will be in every country, and the staff will be swapped every few years to make sure no corruption exists, this body will also be transparent, with another body watching over it, and the same for this body. Redundancy to ensure corruption will not take over nations. The military of each nation will be abolished, and a global police force will be established. Each nation will have their own police force, laws will be passed by the global congress, and each representative is educated in the matter, there will be different types of bodies inside the congress to take care of specific issues. (You must be educated heavily in the matter in order to make a decision) The transparency of the global government is assured, and is a must. Everything is transparent, the government is for the people, not the other way around. Each country will have massive amounts of autonomy, but there will be global law that each country has to respect. Some aspects of the economy will be manged by a global congress, to properly distribute the wealth. The balance of wealthy and poor countries will be critical for the success of this system. Over 200-300 years, a fully globalized world will exist, and the process of developing every country will end 100-200 years after the unification. The main goal of this unification is to eventually cause the underdeveloped nations to develop, and be integrated into the main economy, and bring proper health and education to the world. Now, the problem is where will all of this money come from? How would wealth be distributed fairly and how would everything work in theory. The globalization will be a long term process, with powerful economies being the backbone for poor countries. The taxation system will be based off the strength of the local(country) economy, so the burden of the taxation will not cause the economy too much damage, but will be enough to help the country out with establishing proper education and health care. Some countries will receive subsidies from powerful economies, but that will be a long term investment, the money they gave will be given back (eventually.) Immigrations will be kept under tight control, at the start of the unification it will be heavily monitored, but as the economy of poor countries develop, these restrictions will be lifted. The purpose of this is to make sure there will be no heavy influx of immigrants on wealthy nations, and cause disruptions. The issue of culture differences, and religion or any other type of rivalry will be dealt fairly(Law needs to be expanded) by a global court system, conflicts between nations will be dealt by the global government, and any type of conflict will be heavily criticized and be dealt with by using diplomacy, and if there is no choice armed intervention on each side. (Fight both sides until they stop.) A special police force will be tasked to keep ""hot"" zones ""cooled"" a ""UN"" of sorts, but with ACTUAL law backing them, so no conflict with the local law will occur. (Global law is made to assure the stability of each nation) Each nation will have the right to secede freely, by a referendum of the nation, to prevent any revolts or armed conflicts. I could expand on this for hours upon hours, to fill the little holes, but the gist is here, and I've missed a few points, but I don't want to bore you to death."

If that is the actual language of the clause, or rather if that is what it stipulates, then she wouldn't even be allowed to rent a room in her home to *anyone*, let alone her partner. What will likely happen (and as the article noted) is that this case will get appealed through the TX state court system, likely be affirmed by both the appellate and state supreme court, and she'll likely apply for certiorari to SCOTUS. If the court feels this issue is different in its substance from the two they heard oral argument for last month (which it likely is), then they'll grant cert.

I'm sure she barely knows your name at that point, let alone whether she wants to share her body with you.

He sexually assaulted her. Plain and simple. I'm not saying she should press charges but at the very least he should have shown remorse. Instead, he makes light of it and it plays as a joke. There was no reason for the whole scene whatsoever. He could have said thanks, given her a hug, and they could have been on their way.

Now when you say first star wars film, do you mean only episode one was planned badly, or were you referring to the whole trilogy? The fact that he didn't plan any prequels doesn't mean no planning went into it. There's an entire star wars universe he created. Just because there was no intention of making prequels doesn't make it poorly planned.

1	Yeah, anyone could have done this	pardax	Bitcoin	2	2	0	2013-05	1368916907	He just needs to be a cypherpunk programmer with professional skills in programming. He stood on the shoulders of giants for everything except he originated the idea of the public blockchain to solve the double-spend problem. Essentially he did this by merging the long-tackled e-currency ideas with modern P2P systems. Crypto and hashing just makes it work and is probably something he already well understood but nothing he had to create. With the blockchain idea in place it became just a matter of implementing the system and coding a bulletproof system, which he must have already had the skills to do. It was undoubtedly an idea so compelling that he worked feverishly on it. Creating bitcoin then was probably something he realized he could do with his skills-set at some point, and he just set about doing it, excited by the idea. He would've already been well versed in the practices and theory of internet-based op-sec in order to pull off 1-year+ of anonymity as he did (and this largely precludes working with another programmer). Probably he was employed as a professional programmer, or perhaps an academic of some sort. People call him a world-class programmer for a reason.

If (before Paul) all Gentiles were under Noahide and not in threat of eternal damnation and indeed even capable of having a relationship with God, how do Paul's new rules help them in anyway? Now instead of the Noahide which more or less required nothing more than basic decency, there is a system of belief that must be adhered too along side a series of behaviors and the price for not fulfilling those correctly is eternal damnation. If the Law was death, then Paul's teachings were worse. It's as if Paul was banking on his audience being unaware of Jewish teaching."

1	Better report for unskilled	Kuznecoff	leagueoflegends	1	1	0	2013-10	1381718737	"Player Base News Flash: Reporting A Player Who Died A lot For ""Intentionally Feeding"" Is Wrong. I just had a game where a singed was constantly flaming a fiddlesticks in my team. I was queued with this fiddlesticks and two others, so the Singed was the non-premade on our team. Our fiddle is fairly new to the game, he plays the game incredibly casually, and as such doesn't really work as hard as some people to get better at the game. The singed then started saying that he would report fiddlesticks after the game for feeding. I told him that fiddle wasn't ""intentionally feeding,"" and that in fact he should be the one being reported for verbal abuse. He then said stuff like ""I'm reporting you too for harassment, since you threatened me with a report."" This guy's logic, right? TL;DR - If someone on your team has a lot of deaths you can't just report them for intentionally feeding."

""Sir, did you know that a higher percentage of African-American drug users are imprisoned than white drug users and for longer sentences?"" How could the person who hates drugs possibly support the War on Drugs after hearing that? What could he say: ""Then they shouldn't use drugs""? It's laughable. It would be foolish to make arguments based on things like economics. Why tell the person who hates drugs that the prohibition costs him and other taxpayers an unfathomable amount of money through enforcement and imprisonment and forces what could be huge legal industries and sources of tax revenue into a black market? That would never work because everyone likes to pay higher taxes. Moreover, most people hate jobs."

I go to buy a car from a guy, we decide it's a deal. I give him 15% of the price of the vehicle so he doesn't sell the vehicle to somebody else and we agree on a time and place for the following day to meet up and conclude the rest of the transaction. He doesn't show. I go back to his address and he says he's not giving me the car or the money I gave him. With government I can take him to small claims court and show the receipt he signed. Without any government I go home and grab my AR and have to either kill him or at least use threat of deadly force to attain the property owed to me. This would be even worse with instances of murder where blood feuds would erupt. If someone killed my family member and I had no legal recourse I sure as hell would go kill the perpetrator. Is it not better to have minimal government to handle legal disputes than having to resort to violence because there is no other option?

As it stands, the royals are a waste of money at best. At worst they are a living, breathing symbol of an archaic former political system that we should be striving to move away from and not glorifying as we do. The idea that someone has rights to wealth and estates based solely on their birth should shame us Brits, but it doesn't. We have our heads too far up our own arses."

1	That sounds like socialism to me.	magoo005	politics	1	1	0	2013-08	1377525879	The problem is that PA is too segmented. There isn't just counties, there's municipalities, boroughs, and then cities and towns. And since each little borough and municipality is separate, one borough can be flush with cash, while the one next to it is desperately poor. Example: Most of Allentown is tax exempt since this is where all the govt buildings, post offices, churches, prisons, and police stations are located. And since the rest of the houses in Allentown are worth something like $30,000 on average, Allentown is going broke due to lack of property tax revenue. However, just a couple miles away, the boroughs in the suburbs are flush with cash due to factories providing lots of property tax, fewer children to educate, few tax exempt properties, lower crime, and higher property values. Now do those cash flush boroughs share their wealth with Allentown? Of course not. PA needs to abolish all levels of govt between county and city. That way the cities will share in the wealth generated in the suburbs around the city.

There is NO justification for this, other than the parent did not bother to prepare themselves for this situation (and that is a failure on the part of the parent).

Extra clothes, diapers, snacks, etc. Even after we stopped with the diapers, I still carried around extra clothes and such because children DO have accidents.

1	sounds borng, please don't post any pics	asifnot	Hotwife	1	1	0	2013-05	1367899921	Little Story of the events after our dinner party. We decided to host a dinner party on Saturday and invited three couples over to have dinner and drinks. Things were tame and drink were flowing all night until their remained another couple and ourselves. This is when thing got interesting. One minute I come out from doing a piss and my mates wife had her top off showing my wife her new see through bra. Well as most men would do I encouraged this act by recommending the girls try on my wife's corsets and sexy underwear. So I go upstairs and bring down anything I deemed skimpy and gave it to the girls. At first both were shy and it took several minutes to convince my wife to put on the see through top that goes with the sexy maid outfit she has. Seeing my wife's breast must have turned on our friend as she took off her jeans to reveal a sexy g-string. My wife intrigued with them asked for a closer look where she noticed due to the g-string being see through that our friend had her clit pierced. This made my wife extremely wet and next thing we new our friend was asking my wife what she was doing and my wife replied just seeing if it feel and taste any different when a chick has it pierced. So my wife is now head and tongue first licking out my mates wife. Asfter a minute or so my wife gets up and I ask her to take off her pants and put the matching underwear and skirt for her maid outfit on. But instead she just took her pants off and ended up just having the skirt that doesn't cover anything on and she proceeded to start making out with my mates wife. Things were starting to get really interment until our friends son woke up and we all had to stop. But we have been invited over to their house this weekend for dinner and hopefully so more after dinner entertainment. I do have some pictures of the girls together that I may be willing to share if my wife permits and if there is any interest.

1	If ever there was a reason for CP...	KingKidd	AskReddit	-12	-12	0	2013-01	1357512306	When I was about twelve or thirteen I started talking to this girl in an AOL chatroom (this must have been around 2002, 2003). Being the teenage pervert I was, I sent her a picture of my dick. It pretty much immediately became cyber sex, and she was good at it. So, I added her to my buddy list on AIM and would regularly hit her up to trade nudes, cyber, whatever. Since she lived about 800 miles away, there was no commitment or pressure or anything. Just fun. Well, we kept talking more and more, and over time the conversations started to take on a different dynamic. We started to get to know each other, and share opinions and thoughts. About three years after I first 'met' her, we talked on the phone for the first time. This quickly became nightly two or three hour phone calls from my parent's landline. Over that time, I discovered she was an awesome person and had almost every quality I look for in a girl. But as a poor teenager, any thoughts of her becoming mine were shrouded in doubt. We were on and off 'internet dating', but it seemed so corny and fake. We stayed in touch and I started dating other girls, and eventually went to college. One day she contacted me and told me that her dad got denied loans for her to go to her first choice college, and she applied to my school too. He got accepted for those loans. She was going to attend my college one year below me. I couldn't even believe it, and I was terrified of her meeting me in person. I thought she was going to think I was too short, bad skin, shitty, hair, everything. But I pulled it together and when she came for orientation, I met her at a Red Roof Inn. She was hot. Surprisingly so, and I was pretty intimidated. Since she was only in town three days, we made the most of it and I spent every minute I could with her. We were totally in love when she left to go home for the rest of the summer. During that time, I found us an apartment near the school and we just decided 'fuck it, let's go for it'. Well, that was in 2009. Last June, I asked her to marry me. Ten years after I sent her a picture of my barely-pubescent dick, we are happier than we could ever imagine and engaged to be married in October. She is everything I could ever want and I can't believe the turn of events that led me to her. Anyway, this doesn't fit your description of what you wanted at all, but I never get to tell this story. TL;DR- Sent a thirteen year old girl a picture of my dick, now we're engaged.

1	I just read the TL;DR but it seems legit to me!	cleverseneca	halo	2	2	0	2013-01	1359649949	I felt a little dirty the other day when my opponent had me on no shields, but I swung around top center on Haven and sent one bolt shot to his chest and down he went. I used very little skill to get the kill. A twinge of pity left my heart, as I had been that pursuer many times-- dominating a 1v1 opponent-- only to be BS-ed to death. After the firefight, I had an epiphany. The concept of the BS is awesome. A charging secondary pistol that acts as a mini-shotgun...sweet. There are quite a few aspects of the BS I enjoy: a charge reduces your clip to half capacity, quick shooting intervals similar to magnum, and the graphic/audio qualities. I found the best way to defend against the BS is to listen for it. If you haven't already, you will start to appreciate how pretty this gun can be. Yes, pretty. The initial charging phase has a crisp cushhhh sound, accompanied with the fins of the gun popping out. I find this sequence mesmerizing. The gun charge starts from a dim, lava orange to a bright, ethereal yellow light. Then the charge releases with a PKKKchoww! A thing of beauty. Watching an enemy charge the BS can be an equally enthralling dance. IMO 343i has no choice but to nerf the BS. The question is why is it taking so long? I believe they are waiting for the community to voice their opinion on other OP weapons. Should the Railgun get a nerf? It takes two relatively skilled shots to get a kill with the sniper, but the Railgun is a point and shoot timing weapon. The Railgun can decimate not only one opponent, but the whole enemy team much quicker than any other weapon. My point being that are we happy with the balance of all the weapons? TL;DR -- Give me your upvotes.

TheOtherGuysOpinions	ShitPoliticsSays	0	0	0	2013-01	1359661440	Do these people even remember all the crazy shit they said about Bush? I'm really surprised that Bush made it through his two terms after all of the frenzied psychopathy that was on display in those days. The level of intensity focused on Obama is nowhere near as intense. But, then again, these are the same idiots convinced that the tea party was a violent, racist, ignorant astroturf movement. Of course they'll think any criticism at all is on par with homicidal tenancies. Also, executive orders are hardly 'the democratic means to do things.' And Obama loves some executive orders and executive power grabs.

1	I love shootouts	Subatomic_Molecule	hockey	6	6	0	2013-02	1361333978	Game Thread:Vancouver Canucks at Chicago Blackhawks CANUCKS (8-3-3) at BLACKHAWKS (12-0-3) TV: SNET-P, CSN-CH Last 10: Vancouver 6-2-2, Chicago 7-0-3. Season series: The Vancouver Canucks hold the rare distinction of actually leading their season series with Chicago. The Canucks won their only previous meeting with the Blackhawks, a 2-1 shootout victory on Feb. 1. Big story: The Chicago Blackhawks are 60 minutes away from rarified air, as they look to join the 2006-07 Anaheim Ducks as the only two teams to start a season with 16 games without a regulation loss. That might not be so easy with the Northwest Division-leading Canucks standing in Chicago's way. Team Scope: Canucks: Much of the ink on hot teams in the West has gone to Chicago, but until this past weekend Vancouver was on an impressive hot streak of its own. The Canucks won six straight games while embattled goalie Roberto Luongo performed well enough that he appeared to seize the team's starting role. Their last two outings, however have been particularly frustrating defeats; not only were both games at home, but in each game -- a regulation loss to Dallas on Friday and a shootout loss to St. Louis Sunday night -- the Canucks let a third-period lead slip away. Vancouver still holds the lead in the Northwest, but Minnesota and Edmonton have begun to creep up on first place. Holding that advantage could get tricky in the immediate future for the Canucks. Their tilt in Chicago Tuesday night opens a four-game road trip that will also take them to Dallas, Nashville and Detroit. Blackhawks: The most impressive thing about Chicago's start might not be that it hasn't suffered a regulation loss in 15 games, but rather that the Blackhawks played 10 of their first 12 games away from home. Since returning to the United Center for a seven-game homestand it's been more of the same, as the Blackhawks have gone 2-0-1 in their first three games back in Chicago, including a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings in their last game Sunday afternoon. The Blackhawks now stand on the edge of history as a win, overtime loss or shootout loss will give them 16 games without a regulation loss to start the season a feat equaled only by Anaheim six years ago. Those Ducks ended up winning the Stanley Cup that June. Equaling that feat is obviously the Blackhawks' ultimate goal, but even with a potential Stanley Cup Final trip months away, they'll have an opportunity to write their names in the record books Tuesday night. Who's hot: Daniel Sedin has seven points in his last six games for Vancouver. ... Duncan Keith has been giving Chicago an offensive boost from the blue line with six assists in his last five games. Injury report: Goalie Corey Crawford (upper-body injury) is doubtful for Chicago. While his exact date of return has not been announced, it is believed that David Booth (lower-body injury) may return for Vancouver during its current road trip.

1	Yes, Ron Paul would have protected you from corporations.	Canada_girl	politics	1	1	0	2013-02	1361902140	I totally agree, but I get frustrated because most people I know vote for one of the two corrupt parties instead of for a decent person (Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich would've been ok, too), and there ARE decent people running for a lot of positions, including president, that never get elected. Many voters knowingly vote for corrupt people, and then when things go wrong they blame corporations, etc. when they knowingly played right into the corporations' hands, often helping to market that corrupt candidate for the whole election. I have a hard time taking complaints seriously from people like this. I'm not necessarily saying you're one of those people, but if you voted for Barack or Romney or promoted them, you are. Unfortunately, we both know nothing's going to change soon because people are easily controlled and effect of the media (one of the tools of those in power) isn't easy to overcome. Also, people aren't very smart. Democracy is a decent form of government, but it's not perfect.

1	Yeah, that's why your QB grew up a 49er fan: because NE is a superior organization.	emperoroftexas	49ers	3	3	0	2012-12	1355798049	I'm saying, in short, that your team hasn't won shit in 18 years. Your fan base is all riled up over a regular season win which is indicative of teams that lack post season success. You're also way too excited about a 4 game stretch by a sophomore player. The playoffs could be a rude awakening for Kap. We may have lost last night, and our last two super bowls, but at least we didn't toil at the bottom of the NFL for the decade prior to last season. Your team is the nouveau riche of the NFL and you've yet to prove a thing. Good day sir.

BleinKottle	unitedkingdom	7	7	0	2012-06	1339614434	That's why the jobs in the system have to be ones that wouldn't ordinarily get done, even by minimum wage people. If there's enough interest to employ someone at minimum wage, there is enough interest to say that there is a job and shouldn't be in the scheme. The scheme shouldn't be taking away real jobs. If you take away the scheme (or reduce it by making the companies pay minimum wage for staff), you take away a valuable tool for many people who want to get experience to help them with their job prospects.

Storyline can be anything.... player, team, etc. I'm most excited for RGIII. People compare him to Newton from last season, but I compare him more to Vick, and in my opinion Vick is an even more exciting player than Newton. RGIII is a transcedent talent. Personally, I think the NFL is a little better off when the Redskins are contenders considering the history they have in the league.

The creator asks himself how he can allow others to enjoy his creation while retaining the exclusivity of it, and thus the exclusive right to profit from it. The solution is to create a limited right to enjoy his property and sell it, much like the way concert tickets are created and sold. In that way, creators have opened an enormous potential market, with numerous capitalists willing to take the risk of investing in creative ventures in return for all future profits. Consumers get to benefit from creative works that could never exist before because creators could not win back their investment. I don't know how you can be for the free market and oppose this property.

Ron Paul's plan to remove jurisdiction from the Supreme Court is the largest threat to American civil liberty of all time. It would be the death of the Constitution. I'm not exaggerating. Though, I do believe if he truly understood the danger in what he was proposing he'd probably change his mind on that. It would allow the Congress via a simple majority vote to bar the federal courts from judging whether their laws are unconstitutional. This would mean in practice, the constitution would no longer carry any legal weight. The We The People Act is the dumbest bill I can imagine a so called libertarian could write.

Now we have the murders of over 40,000 people in a nation that we share a border with basically financed by American civilians. And yet the popular media focuses almost entirely on the perpetrators of these crimes. Yes the cartels are vicious, murderous thugs. But they are bought and paid for with money they get from the American populace. And they murder people with weapons they purchase from the American arms merchants. Our insistence that the ""Drug War"" can be won through policy and policing, contrary to overwhelming evidence that it cannot, is destabilizing the entire society of one of our most important trade partners. How long can we expect their populace to sit by and tolerate this? Tldr; American policy, apathy, and hypocrisy is fueling terrible international crime at an unprecedented level."

Smaller cameras like the sony nex series have what you described and have much more than the average facebook sharing amateur needs in regards to image quality. no one with a d3 will want to share photos straight from camera to facebook.

The problem is, are the costs of entry into sports these days set too high by these contracts that ESPN has created with these conferences?

One way to crash it is a pump and dump - buy a shit tonne and do a mass sell off before it can rise 5$ more. People would preemptively buy more in an attempt to cash into a spike and would lose money when it falls. It falls and then they sell off to try and break even. Rinse and repeat. Value is inversely correlated with liquidity. If the goverment wanted to troll bitcoin, all they need to do is manipulate a large enough value I fail to see how taking down darknet sites would affect the liquidity, since so many people just hold onto the damn coins.

There is always going to be a place where you draw a limit, people drink coffee to excess especially in the states and get hooked on it. A caffeine addiction is an addiction nonetheless, and in an ideal world people would understand the dangers and regulate what they put in their bodies. I can't speak for you but I wasn't really taught a lot of food and healthcare stuff at school. The few home economics classes I did were baking cakes and such. If no one teaches kids how to maintain a healthy lifestyle, how will they know how to do it? You could say the parents but most of the parents don't do it or know how to either. The human race as a whole abuses a lot of things that is safe in moderation, we should be striving for a culture where we moderate our intakes ourselves, and I don't believe legalising drugs does that.

Every time regulations are made to try to restrict big business it just ends up on the backs of smaller businesses while the big guys work their way around it. Personally, to get more full time employment I think the best solution would be a reduction in entitlements / making it easier to get rid of people in small businesses. I would also define ""small business"" per industry sector rather than just as a number of people."

Or maybe people could just stop assuming they need to know everything about everyone and just give them the benefit of the doubt?

IroN_MiKe	dayz	0	0	0	2013-06	1371707535	Why is KOS looked down upon? I'm a survivor who prefers to play solo and I take no unnecessary risks Here's how I play Day-Z: lone wolf. I tried to play with others and co-operate but I have always ended up being betrayed. Its just not fun trusting in other players only to be killed by them because they are so insecure. I play a lone bandit now and honestly I find it much more rewarding to play by myself. I avoid other people, shooting them only if I have no alternative. If someone starts coming after me though... or they are too close for comfort... I will take them out. I've been betrayed in this game way too many times to trust anyone I encounter. I even joined a clan and they betrayed me over a stupid sniper rifle... I even told them I don't want it but they killed me to make sure I didn't try anything.. WTF? I feel like everyone on this subreddit hates lone wolf play or bandits who KOS. Its a survival game for a reason. You either die to zombies or other players, or you live long enough to be betrayed by someone you trusted for a long time. If a zombie apocalypse happened IRL, I'm going solo.

0	So are you implying all men are gay up until 14?	redditallreddy	politics	3	3	0	2013-04	1365850049	Look at me. I take the hit to reddit karma just because I'm legit. I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror if I let this pass. Sure, I'll help you. Homosexuals don't develop beyond 14 as stated. Somebody wrote a blog about this in great detail. Homosexuals have their 'Peter Pan' syndrome. This is true. Your brains aren't set up for complex thinking. This is blatantly obvious when you don't understand how a woman's body fits together for legit sex, you don't know how to jerk yourselves off so you have to find another homo to do it. You can't have conversations with other people. All you can do is the same shit I did when I was in grade school. You'd have gang fights behind the school against people who are from different classes. You don't have any other differentiation, nor does it matter to you. All you know is heterosexuals are your enemy and you're going to devote your entire life to destroying them. Who spends their time sleazing it up to women? Those guys only exist in cartoons and the Italian community. You live that way, except instead of the satisfaction of the female you *use other men.* Humans/ heterosexuals or what you refer to as homophobes will always pique your interest. We HAVE interests. We like to play video games, we like to read books, we like movies, we like physical activity. This is also the reason you're always going to be more attracted to men you deem to be more heterosexual than you. You're going to spend your entire life trying to 'turn' straight men because nobody's attracted to gay men. It's kind of like that fascination with virgins and young girls I don't understand.

0	Having a higher skill floor generally also means you have a higher skill cap, if there are more things to learn before you are proficient at a basic level the more things there are to keep on your mind at any given time thus also increasing the skill cap, not that anyone is realistically going to reach the skill cap of any these games.	LoadingArt	Smite	0	0	0	2013-06	1371946429	I think the trouble is that what you're talking about isn't necessarily a matter of a skill ceiling but of a skill floor. Smite's draw is that the skill floor is incredibly low compared to other MOBAs. It's intuitive, visceral, and far far less about the metagame relative to your ability to land skillshots, be aware, position yourself, etc.

First, cooking meth was to provide for his family, *not* pay his medical bills so -- unless Gretchen and Elliott were going to support Walt's family for the next 20+ and send his kids to college -- retiring from meth to accept the charity would not accomplish Walt's primary goal. Second, Walt is, arguably, as loyal as he is proud -- he recognizes that Gus totally *saved* his ass from the silver-suit wearing assassins and, again, arguably feels indebted to the man. So, while a lot of fans are bagging on Walt for being this huge douchebag for remaining in The Game, there *are* reasons besides simply labeling him a prideful prick.

But for them to lay off 20% of the team and shelf their get out of jail free card is them raising a white flag and this marks the beginning of the downward spiral. If a company releases a shitty product, that's meh, because you can still recover as long as you have fundage.

WarzoneOfDefecation	funny	46	46	0	2013-12	1388288882	Hello, just to clear up a little confusion. No, the vehicle carrying the reigning monarch does not require a number plate, tax or an MOT certificate. But all of her vehicles have these except for 2 which carry her in times of emery, and are fitted with blue lights and sirens. (even these have a range of fake plates.) Her majesty does not require a driving licence.... She had one any way. Her majesty, Elizabeth the 2nd worked in the women's core in the 2nd world war. She was a princess, but had a full driving licence and built lorry and jeep engines towards the war effort. She hasn't had her licence renewed, but under common grandfather rights, it would have been up to date until her 65th birthday. Unfortunately it is now expired. However what you see here is her majesty driving on their private hunting grounds, for which no person requires a licence in the UK.

So i dont ride yet, due to insurance being through the roof on even a 250 and being Canadian a car is a bigger priority. anyways whenever theres a motorcycle in the lane next to me i do as i do with cyclist and move as far over as i safely can in my lane. yesterday heading to Toronto for Ertefa (SOME SICK BIKES WERE THERE) i was on the Lincoln Alexander Parkway, aka the Linc which has two lanes then eventually for a short distance has 4 two split off two Brantford the other two split off to Toronto. okay so i was in the middle toronto lane, moved to the right of my lane because mister biker was in the middle brantford lane and was directly beside me ( traffic was meh) my lane was moving faster so i got about 2 cars ahead, anyways the split off was coming and he managed to get beside me again, then ahead, but not too much like maybe half a car length, i was watching him because first i didnt really trust him and second i like to look at bikes, and without signaling he just cut in in front (note theres a car litterally a car length in front of me) and since the lanes split theres only two lanes now but the other lane ends shortly. so i hit the brakes, quickly checked as i was switching into the other lane and was good, scared me a bit. the biker proceeded to flip me off, whatever my cars still good hes alive im alive it moves on. so the Link turns nto highway 403 like litterally right there, Link ends and were now merged onto the 403 im still about 3 car lengths behind him, i moved to the passing lane passed a few cars including him and moved back over driving at the speed i was comfortable with, mister biker comes along next to me and started gettign closer (note i moved over as i usually do in my lane just in case) and he gets close enough to what felt like him kicking my car? then he fuckered off in the passenger lane (next to the passing lane you can only use it if you have a passenger, which he did not) I was pissed, got to ertefa, there was a scuff mark, washed the car at esso and scuff was gone nobody got hurt just thought id share, and what type of bike? well im not quite sure tbh I know it was a sports bike and said Suzuki and it was white and blue."

I had an ex that was ""turned on"" when I wore my glasses. Some people are turned on by loads of skin. Some guys think that collarbones are the sexiest part of a woman's body. Some are attracted to wrists. Others are attracted to ankles, legs, whatever. And SOME guys are turned on by the thought of knowing a woman is all covered up! Making me responsible for the thoughts of others is a battle I can never win. I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. Instead of making me responsible for the thoughts of others, how about holding people responsible for their own actions? You can't murder someone just because they look a certain way....we all agree that is wrong. So why is it ok to commit other acts of violence agasint them? Love your body. And sure, dressing appropriately for occasions is important...I'm not going to wear a clubdress to church (because it's not appropriate for that setting). But I refuse to be shamed because my legs are showing, and a guy is turned on. I refuse to be shamed if I wear a dress that flatters my figure.

If more states broke down their presidential votes as a portion of their population it would better represent the wishes of the state as a whole as opposed to an all or nothing.

We need more progressive taxation, not less. More unions, not less. More regulation, not less. It was Clinton (and a Republican congress) acting in a fiscally conservative manner by not vetoing the repeal of Glass-Steagall, followed by the Fed acting fiscally conservative by keeping interest rates dangerously low in the 2000s, not to mention the whole Bush presidency and congress acting is a permissive way through the 2000s that gave us the 2008 crash. While you can't pin it on one party, you can pin the crash on fiscal conservatism as a philosophy. Similarly, fiscal conservatism and lack of regulation caused the crash of 1929 and Great Depression.

I know that makes no sense, but let me explain. So if you go to see a comedy, generally you can bring anyone along, regardless of how close you are. (well, depending on what type of comedy and it's rating) However, more serious movies, if you've never seen them before can be risky, you have less of a sense of what you're expecting and how the other person might react, because you're not close enough to them. It's why generally, you should go to a movie which has an actor/director whose work you're familiar with and know what to expect and how to react, but imagine going to see something depressing with lots of violence, which you weren't expecting, it's harder to know how to react to your partners reaction. Also there's the whole fact that the movie you go to see could set the tone for the rest of the date, especially if you're not close to the other person. My general rule is, if you wouldn't see it with your mum, don't see it as a first date movie. I hope this helps and makes sense, just a bit tired.

Being told they're part of the patriarchy, and are too privileged to know it. Men sacrifice their bodies every day to make this country what it is, and they get trampled for it. I want to make sure that people know of their sacrifice. There's a lot of hate about ""toxic masculinity."" Many other groups want to tell men what we are, and who we should be (aka ""don't be that guy""). But I say fuck them. We bust our asses off, and get spit on for it.

1	yay job creators!	JamStrat	AskReddit	1	1	0	2013-08	1375731272	basically it works that the more money you make, the less taxes you pay because the larger your business the more of the economy (individual workers) you support and the government can get their taxes via them. IE you me average joe pays between 25 and 40%. Last election cycle it was well noted that Romney paid 17%. Warren buffet paid 11% the year that legislation had to be passed for the debt ceiling which also reported that most multinational conglomerates pay between 4 and 10%. tl;dr; Reagan's trickle down economics...let the big dogs grow (tax breaks) and the the little guys will grow with them...unfortunately not anymore. I think the huge change here is the advancement of technology and the ability of corporations to replace individual workers with automated systems. edit for humor...The auto-wait. serving tables near you in fall 2014.

In the time it takes to attend a two hour funeral over 500 Americans will have died. And, once again, that's *just* the United States, with its 4% of the world population. So yeah, we make jokes about people dying. Because although it's a terrible tragedy for the people connected to those particular two people, for the world at large it's business as usual. People are dying all the time, we joke about it because it helps us avoid confronting the uncomfortable fact that we might be next.

Bob will push his work load over onto you, run off and hide in the bathroom to text his friends, and call off work so you get fucked over. Your boss comes over and tell you that you're just as good as Bob and you don't deserve to be treated any better in the work place, or make any more money, or move up the corporate ladder any faster than him.

I mean it was your average middle school relationship but she really dug the guy apparently. So over the summer this kid goes to summer camp and him and my sister continue to correspond in letters. When the punk gets back it turns out he has this new girlfriend he met at camp and didn't bother to tell my sister. What's worse is that because of how contentious it was between them a bunch of her friends end up abandoning her. They both basically had the same circle of friends, and it kind of became a situation where their friends had to choose one of them, and he was very popular. She's all crying and upset and in this spiral of low self-esteem; constantly listening to that Christina Aguilera song, ""Beautiful"" over and over and over again. Well time goes on and the new school year begins. It turns out this punk is some kind of hotshot baseball player and he is captain of the JV team. I had also tried out for the JV team that year (I wasn't great, but I was our only decent catcher). Once I get on the team I start to suck up to him and pretend we are all cool. The guys on the team would sort of rotate hosting these parties on the weekend. Well toward the middle of the season my parents go out of town, and it comes to my turn. So I throw this big bash and invite everyone. Only I tell the punk it's a bigger party than just the team and to invite any friends he wants to. And wouldn't you know it he comes with his friends and new girlfriend in tow. So the party is going on and all seems normal. Then suddenly I put Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful"" on the stereo system. It's really out of place given the playlist thus far. When the punk asks what the deal is I look him square in the face put, my arm on his shoulder, and tell him ""My sister sends her regards"". Then I plunge a knife in his chest and he cries out for his dog (which he brought with him). Only he doesn't realize I killed his dog earlier. At this point people are freaked out. His whole circle of friends who abandoned my sister, well they are just trying to get out. Only all the doors are locked and then all my family and friends come out with knives and we just slaughter the fuck out of them. It was a decent party. Things are pretty great now. Only now this fat kid keeps giving me dirty looks, but he's a useless fatass so I'm not that concerned."

Who should pay on a date has been a topic that's come up quite a bit between myself and a few people I've been talking to (one of them being a poster on r/okc that I've been texting with and he and I respectfully disagree with each other) . Before I ask this question, I want to say that there is no hard and fast **rule** that says you ""should"" do this or ""should"" do that. My opinion: - First date: If as a guy, you get the vibe that you want to take her out again and you think she will say yes, you should attempt to pick up the whole tab. **The woman should offer to split it**. I always have, the only times I haven't are on dates where the guy was being a pig. If you take the money from her, that's fine. Personally, if I like a guy and he picks up the first tab, he gets an extra brownie point with me, but if he doesn't pick it up, he doesn't lose anything. - Second date: If the guy picked up date 1, girls, we should pick up date 2. It's just common courtesy. If the first tab was split, guys, you should definitely pay for this one, or don't go on a third date. If the second date is split, I usually don't see a romantic possibility with the guy. - Third date: By this point, if date one was split, date two was the guy, this 100% needs to be the ladies. Guys, if the girl doesn't pick up a tab after you've already paid for one, she is in it for the monetary ""perks"" of dating. When I meet someone I like, I **want** to take a guy out too. That's just me. So here's the part where I want you to tell me what you think: - Ladies, how do you feel about offering to pay when the bill comes? Do you pick up any of the tabs in the first 3 dates? Do you look at a guy differently if he doesn't pay date one? - Guys, do you mind letting the girl pay for you? Do you feel you shouldn't have to pay for the whole tab at all? Do you look at a girl differently if she doesn't offer to split the tab? **I don't do dinner dates until several dates in. The first 3 dates are usually drinks and I make sure to be considerate when I order. I'm a big fan of seasonals on tap while on dates. Sure I like the mixed drinks but it's just rude to order three or four $15 drinks at this stage in building a relationship. If a woman is doing this to you, then personally I wouldn't take her out again.** (Quick OKC story - I went on a date and the bill comes, the guy looks at me and says ""So, how we going to do this? Split it?"" Don't do that guys. *That* was tacky. Go into it expecting the woman isn't going to offer on date one. If she does and you take it, cool, but don't ever say, ""So you owe..."" or ""How we going to do this?"" Unless of course she was a total bitch. Then by all means..) *Apologies to the GLBT community. I haven't thought about social norms in relation to this group as of yet. One day I will look into it a little more*"

Well yes, but make no mistake : it will a jobless recovery. Or at least with significant less manual labor. Proponents of this trend claim that this is a good thing (""creative destruction"") because now these workers become available for other, more productive, jobs. The problem here is that the jobs that do come available demand a higher skill level. And some workers just do not have that level for any number of reasons. Therefore they need to discount their offer and accept lower wages to still compete. I strongly believe this is one of the key drivers between the growing disparity of wealth in industrialized society. America can pull back a significant number of manufacturing jobs, especially when transport costs keep rising and automation progresses. But it will not return the country to the golden age of full employment and factory wages that can sustain a family on one income."

I think a major factor behind its abortion (other than the community opposition previously mentioned) was the TA's fiscal situation. (They were almost broke every single time, I believe.) The first attempt was the tunnel mentioned here. If this were completed, the R would have gone past 95th Street and entered SI via the Verrazano Narrows. The bridge *was* built to support subway tracks for this reason. While this obviously didn't happen, this is the reason why the tunnel past 95th Street actually goes to 100th Street. The second attempt was done a few miles south near 38th Street. If this were completed, trains going this route would have gone down to 1st Avenue via Bush Terminal (now home to Costco and a future park) and somehow made its way into SI. One can see the remains of this project by looking left after passing 36th Street and the overpass for D trains heading towards Coney Island. Right underneath it is a skeleton for this underpass. If there were track beds, they have long since been removed. However, that passage is lit for some reason. The TA's final attempt was a little past Whitehall Street just a few feet behind the start of the Montague Street Tunnel. This didn't get very far; if one looks outside on the right-hand windows of a R train, there are two very short tunnels right past Whitehall; one of them much bigger than the other. The TA really, really wanted this to happen. Staten Island would be in much better shape if it did, IMO.

1	Lol, I'm sure retailers are doing this so they can provide lower prices to their cash customers.	Level1Engineer	personalfinance	0	0	0	2012-12	1356850846	Hire more cashiers? Things cost more. Credit card companies (VISA, MC, AMEX, etc.) take a percentage fee 3% - and more with rewards cards (earn 5% on groceries, or 3% on gas, etc.). Processors take a percentage fee (2 or 3%) AND a per-transaction fee ($0.25 to $1.25). And, a lot of buyers finance purchases, earning fees for banks (9% to 27%). For a long time, retailers have been eating the cost and passing it on to everyone. Now cash buyers get an advantage and maybe Americans can wean themselves off credit cards.

The exact same thing goes for Israel in dealing with Hamas.

Phone hardware design is pretty much in lock-step so we'll have a few quad-core devices from android and then a quad-core from apple later in the year as well which will be nice but they will all still be essentially the same hardware just a newer iteration. Don't go thinking phone hardware is inherently different, like say the architectures of a PS3 vs Xbox 360, because you'd be mistaken. The end user experience in a mobile environment is far more dependent on the OS design than it is the hardware. But I only say that because I know what I'm talking about."

The nazis, if they did anything right, kept amazing records. Unlike, say, the Armenian genocide where all the records were burned, locked away, or otherwise denied, we can look at the nazi registers and see that X Jew left Y town on Z date, and then went to Concentration Camp A and died on date B. We have photos from Auschwitz, Dachau, etc showing mountains of sheared hair, eyeglasses, bones, etc. We have witness testimonies that survive until today. We have the Nuremberg trial transcripts. Unlike the Armenian genocide, we have very exact numbers on who died, where and when. Nazis loved records. Conspiracy theorists tend to be semi-intelligent people who want to be perceived as more intelligent than they are, so they cling to bogus theories to feel smarter than the rest of the people, who they view as idiots that believe everything they are told. Holocaust deniers are the same; they feel clever having ""figured out"" a massive government conspiracy. They get so hooked on the feeling of intellectual superiority that it creates a sort of dissociation from reality wherein all evidence to the contrary of their theory gets interpreted as a government lie and even the slightest shred of evidence that it didn't happen becomes a diamond in the rough that only they are ""smart enough"" to see."

The same goes the other way round: if I learn my partner is or has been gathering evidence (or tried to do so), then that's a reason to leave, much more so than cheating in a case were it just happened once. Taking ""pre-legal"" steps is a planned, calculating act, and one of great mistrust. If I believe she might get this nasty once she finds out, then I'm not sure she's the right person in any case. The ability to solve problems in a grown up, respectful way, is very elemental to any relationship, at least in my opinion. Spying on someone I care about for legal actions or for my own assertion is not respectful. Cheating is not, either of course, but it can happen. And when it does, it needs to be talked about - also, in a respectful way. The same basically goes for the always wondering part: if I confront her and she says nothing happened, I can chose to believe her and forget about it. It's a choice, a choice to trust her. If I keep wondering, then that's an issue of mistrust, and I'm not sure any hard evidence would really fix this. All together, I consider cheating (or the suspicion thereof) is, basically, an issue of trust, and it can not be solved by more mistrust."

Obama was specifically talking about how those in the Middle East and N.

The people have to wonder what comes next since the same ruthless authorities re-take power. It has absolutely nothing to do with NWO.

Captaincastle	gaming	1	1	0	2012-11	1354156477	There's lots of things that every company should do but doesn't, even the better ones. For example I watched TB's WTF of Far Cry 3 the other day. The game looks great, with a decent amount of graphic options. But then you go to the audio menu to discover the only options are master volume, music on/off, and the language of subtitles. So you're telling me I can't lower the volume of the SFX in case I want to hear the music better, or vice versa or whatever. I haven't played the game yet so I'm not positive how important these options would be to this game, but I have seen them in plenty of other much lower budget FPS. It seems to me if there is one thing that should be formulaic in video games genres, it should be the options menu, and in some cases, the UI. I'm looking at you console versions of Skyrim!

0	Racism level: Ultimate.	rackgen	india	3	3	0	2013-12	1386559252	As a Malaysian, I'm not at all surprised this happened in Singapore. Both our countries treat Indian and Bangla nationals like utter shit. Singapore probably never saw it coming. In Malaysia, its baffling how us multiracial Malaysians can immediately unite when it comes to a foreign worker offending us. Let me give you guys an example: a couple of Malay girls in my neighbourhood went for a walk and never returned. A group of locals (Malays, Indians, Chinese, etc) banded up and went STRAIGHT to the cheap housing areas where Bangla and India nationals lived, barged in and forcibly searched the premises. They were the default suspects and yet we never found anything. The two girls returned later home later that evening. It turned out they had stopped at a field to watch a game and didn't bother to update their parents.

PabstyLoudmouth	politics	0	0	0	2013-01	1358746578	Australia has just had every weather record it knows smashed over the past three years as the weather responds dramatically to climate change, as predicted. Hottest day on record nationally, and regional centres all over the country, worst cyclones, worst floods, worst bush fires, coldest winter, hail storms destroying houses and cars across Sydney and Melbourne - pretty much anything that can go wrong is going wrong - and it is costing not millions - but BILLIONS - many people all over the country can no longer even get home insurance, no matter HOW MUCH THEY PAY as it is declared uninsurable. We can not insure our cars due to hail. This is before we head back into El Ninio and a projected 15 year drought which will decimate global wheat, rice, cotton, beef, dairy and lamb as a major world agricultural supplier, along with Russia, US, Brazil and Africa - things are about to get very fucking pear shaped.

It is, but in certain religious groups i.e. the mormons it is considered acceptable to sleep with more than one woman, as a man, if you are married within their church. Marriage within a church does not equate to marriage by law. 2. What's on TV isn't all there is to the story. Only the pieces of footage deemed most entertaining by the editors is shown. That leaves a lot of cut footage and circumstances. For instance, what an investigation would look into IRL would be things like benefits claims. If more than one wife applied for and received the same benefit on things that were only supposed to go to the legally married spouse, well, that's a bit too boring for television.

Anything less than 30-40/hr will be a waste of time in the long run if you ever have kids/house/nice car.

0	Upvote for the $5,000 car.	ThereAreFourLights_	personalfinance	2	2	0	2013-12	1386844027	It's great that you are employed, graduated college, saving money by living at home, have no debt (!), and are thinking about a budget. My suggestions would be: - You should start building an emergency fund. 3-6 months of expenses. See the link on the right. - With so much take home pay, you should be saving as much as possible of your income in a 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA. - A $400/month car is really a mistake at age 22. You can buy a used, nice, and fun car for $5000 and it'll be yours in a few months. Let's say you invest 3 years of those payments instead. That could have been $366,000 in your retirement account at age 65. (At 8% return per year which is realistic once you factor in dividends.) - I suspect you are spending more than you think. Get a budget going on Mint.

The center I mentioned before had a central server setup that ran multiple copies off of one PC. With DRM as it is going now, that will likely not be possible for me. But some games still might let it work. Or just have the game on a few PCs to start.

0	Let us know in about a year if your girlfriend views a new stereo and a new TV as a mutual benefit.	TheChrisHill	AskReddit	1	1	0	2013-05	1368030300	I'm not married, but I have a long term girlfriend of 4 years that I will be moving in with in a year. In my opinion, the proportional bill splitting (as OP is describing) makes sense to me, but only when it comes to bills. The way I view things it doesn't matter a whole lot if the disposable income isn't shared, because 80% of purchases will probably benefit both parties (new TV, eating out, new stereo system, etc.). In my situation, the only things that I would buy that would solely be for me would be things like video games, which is *maybe* $60 a month, with a new computer/console every 3 years minimum. However, I can definitely go without a new game or 3 if it means buying my SO an expensive birthday gift.

So... first we'd have to suspend those rights, yeah? Suspend constitutional rights for a specific class of citizens. Then we just round them up and put them all in one place... some sort of enclosed encampment where we can keep them out of the way? So we... concentrate the homeless into this camp? And of course this is all MUCH more expensive than welfare, food stamps, or homeless shelter programs. So we'd need to offset the cost by putting the homeless to work. Some sort of work-for-food program or something. Or... maybe just forget the food. Sounds familiar.... But it's definitely a solution. A final solution, to be sure.

How do you think our government would? (/xpost from AskReddit) Bored 23 year-old here. Just a question I've always wondered! Like a lot of others, I'm fed up with our government--the legislative branch in particular. And though I feel that an act like this would be a tragedy, I can't help but feel that I'd secretly be in favor of what it might force our government to do. While killing is never a publicly advocated solution, it seems that attacking our Congress directly would send a ripple across the nation. Kind of like a killswitch for a hard reset--one that says, ""look at this event, it happened for a reason and not because of shoddy security measures."" While of course the bomber would become somewhat of a martyr, he might achieve his goal in having our government examine what Congress is doing wrong to draw such hostility. This is all just speculation, like a parallel universe or historical fiction book. God forbid this happens in the next week and I become suspect. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; **TL;DR: American bomber kills off the majority of Congress in an attack--how do you react?

The opening shot of looking out the portal of the space station while the camera slowly rotates and zooms out is wonderful. It gives you this vertigo feeling and strikes home the notion that there is no ""up"" and ""down"" in space. Unfortunately this shot doesn't hold nearly as much impact on a TV screen as it does in when I first saw it in the theater. The second amazing opening shot is when you just see the Event Horizon against the backdrop of the storms of Neptune. Simply amazing. Basically this movie is simply ""Let's make a haunted house movie in space"" but it's really well done. There aren't many horror movies that can creep me out with multiple viewings, and this one definitely can. Whoever went through and grabbed these stills did a great job."

I also think men's studies have value for me as a topic all on it's own and not just as a critical response to feminism. Again, I ask that you provide something you think I could learn something from.

Regardless it still kind of irks me when I read it), and in Order of the Phoenix, when Harry never uses the mirror Sirius gave him to keep in contact with him, and he doesn't even think to use it to check on Sirius to make sure he was still at his house, and eventually gets Sirius killed from it.

If you want to keep living at the high means that you currently are, sure, but you are indeed rich, so that takes more income to continue. If you want to live in an average manner, considering social security and other variables, you can retire with much less than that, or with zero if your pension is good enough. My parents are regular middle class, but when my dad retires in three years, he will be making about $110k/yr. with his pension, 401k, and social security, and he's never made more than (I'm estimating here) $60k in a year. So to sum up, if you want to live like you're rich, you need to retire with more than two million. And no, I'm not talking Hilton rich, but realistic.

I think sometimes a rappers' voice is somewhat overlooked, for me it really can make a big difference on how I take to a rapper (first impressions in particular). The combination of a good voice and a good flow is just unbeatable. For me personally the one who really stands out in this category is GZA, he is just untouchable when it comes to the combination of voice and flow. Also Big Boi is up there too. (very underrated IMO, one of my favourite rappers ever and somebody who I feel doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, one of the best rappes ever for me). Who do you guys love when it comes to voice and flow?

1	Also, the more obvious reason you would burn more, is that you are getting much closer to the sun when you go up to the hill, so you become hotter and burn more calories.	simple10	explainlikeimfive	0	0	0	2013-10	1382822142	Not a physiology expert, but walking up a hill obviously burns more than walking on a flat surface, as you are fighting gravity etc. Now, if you think about walking down a relatively steep hill, it is also harder than walking on a flat surface. You have to lower your body in a controlled manner on one leg, as opposed to walking on a flat surface, where the degree of knee, ankle and hip flexion/extension is not as great. In other words, you still have to burn energy in coming down the hill in a controlled motion. This is not the same as say a bike, where there is more energy being burned on the way up, but none to very little burned on the way down. I could be wrong, but Im pretty sure you would burn more going up and down the hill.

""Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."" 2 Corinthians 9:7 As others have stated, the parable of the Good Samaritan illustrates the voluntary nature of charity in the Bible as well. Socialism is, whether or not any socialist wants to admit it, based upon coveting the materiel wealth of the wealthy- very anti-biblical.

Anyone could make one, if they had a 3D printer...which costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars. People think of zip guns, if they think of them at all (I doubt it for the majority) they think of pieces of crap more dangerous to their user than anyone else. They don't understand 3D printing, so they assume you can just print out advanced mechanical designs and make automatic weapons."

0	No.	phycologist	AskMen	1	1	0	2013-05	1369426122	If a girl waxes down below does it disgust you in the weeks between waxing when there's a little hair? I went out with this guy recently (both of us are late 20s), and on our second date we were kissing, things getting a bit heated. I was up front before that I wasn't ready to have sex yet, and he was fine with that. There was still some over the pants touching for both of us, and he starts moving his hand down my jeans. I pulled his hand away because I know that would be a tease and escalating things, but also because I'm due in for my wax next week, so it's not completely smooth down there, which I'd like before our first time. He laughs at me and calls me a 'hairy girl' and comments about not knowing how to maintain. Now, he said it in a joking manner, not in disgust, but I was still slightly offended. Plus, he hit a nerve since an ex boyfriend would make comments like that even though I always had monthly waxes, so there was just a small window where there is minimal hair. Guys, is it that disgusting that a girl has a little hair in between waxing? By a little hair I really mean that. It's not like the enchanted forest down there, but some minimal growth, which is necessary to actually get waxed each time. I know I could shave, but it irritates my skin and waxing makes it smoother longer. Is it a dealbreaker if the girl isn't perfectly smooth 24/7?

He had a huge problem from one particular household that would order every single friday, because they KNEW it was impossible for the driver to get there on time. So, he finally had enough of having his business exploited one Friday. He knew exactly what they would order, and almost exactly when they would order it. He had it made ahead of time so that it was possible to get there on time (I think possibly he sent the driver out early as well). Twist, he was the driver. He delivered the pizza on time and the people didn't have the money to pay with, since they were expecting to get it for free. He basically told them to stop exploiting his business and to fuck off. They stopped exploiting the rule. He's told me this story a couple times, and it checks out as the same each time. He's also a rather successful person, so I don't doubt the validity to his claims.

Every year around this time, people start posting photos of extremely muddy bikes. We all get that this might seem interesting to someone who is riding in this kind of weather for the first time, but very often it is also a sign that you just contributed to ruining a trail. When the ground is thawing and the weather is wet, the trail will be soft through and through. Your bike sinks in, makes ruts, takes topsoil away. The next time it rains a new puddle forms, and pretty soon the trail needs serious work or it will wash away completely. If you have 10 pounds of trail on your bike after the ride, you are doing it wrong. People, usually fellow riders and volunteers, spend many hours each spring fixing trails after the winter time, many of which were needlessly damaged by people riding them way too soon. Be smart, ride waterproof gravel trails or just stick to bike paths until the trails are dried out enough. And to address two things that always get posted in response to this: YES I realise that not all trails self destruct in the wet, (some are fairly water proof such as a lot of the PNW and B.C.). But a lot of them certainly do, and I have spend many hours fixing them. Also, YES, its mountain biking and the trails are supposed to have obstacles and rough surface. That is not what I'm talking about. I'm not dumbing down trails. Having giant mud puddles causes people to ride around them, which widens the trail and causes erosion. That is what's dumbing down your trails.

Back in college I had a Physical Anthropology professor who was the rambling sort; I don't have a proper source for this, but it was his example of how much we've tightened up our ideas of ""race"" in the past two millennia. On Roman excursions deep into Africa, they regularly brought some representatives of the tribes they found there back to Rome. Attempted to teach them Latin, indoctrinate them in Roman manners and styles of dress, etc. One pair of emissaries never really picked up on most of it, but they were dignitaries, so when they died in Rome they were buried properly. Anthropologists were initially baffled when they dug up a couple of chimpanzee skeletons."

I was watching the oncoming cars to my left, looking for an opening, when a huge Suburban pulled up on my driver's side, outside the lane, blocking the view from my Civic window. This was my usual route to work in the morning so I was used to seeing people try and pull this maneuver. Apparently pulling up along side people in the front of the line so you can get out sooner than them is a genius idea many people have had. I didn't think much of it, just sighed, slightly annoyed, and waited for her to pass. Well, apparently she totally forgot I was even there are turned too sharply to the right when she merged and scrapped the driver's side of my car so badly my door literally just fell off right there in the street. My car still ran well enough to pull over to the side of the road with her before we called the police. I didn't really talk to her, just waited in my mangled car for the police to arrive. It honestly never occurred to me that she would or could possibly say it was anyone else's fault but hers. When the policewoman got there she got my side of the story and then hers and then she came back to me and said she claims it was my fault...that I had pull up along side HER! I looked back at the pieces of my car lying on the inside of the single lane I was waiting in earlier. INSIDE the lane. I pointed them out to the policewoman and she just shrugged and said it probably wasn't my fault, but that's not what this other woman claims. It ended up being no fault and I had to pay out the ass to get my car fixed. Just to paint a picture: I was about 23, well groomed, dressed in business casual attire as I was on my way to work. This woman in the suburban was probably in her early 50s, in a dirty tank top and hot pants with a tramp stamp. Classic trashy mom. How in the world the policewoman even pretended to believe her story over mine I will never know. I guess that's just the way it goes. People... :/

Plus it's the fact that he's parking his fortune overseas to evade taxes (blind trusts my ass). He expects us to believe that a micro-manager like himself would just allow a vast chunk of his wealth be blindly managed by somebody else... yeah, right. Especially when he tries to convince us what a great businessman he is... then why not repatriate that money and manage it yourself? Oh yeah, that tax evasion thing. So, he's one of those rich guys who is currently helping to tank the economy, and his idea of how to balance the books is cut social programs and go to war with Iran, oh, and to also make the tax cuts for the rich permanent. That's worked so well up until now. Do you know that at one time only capital gains were taxed, and labor wasn't? And now labor is taxed higher than capital gains? wtf?

And they don't put little warnings on the back of my books, ""Caution: Sadistic Author"", so I can't very well avoid it. I'm just frustrated that every author who thinks they need to be dark and edgy resorts to raping their own characters. You don't need to have someone raped to make me, the reader, connect with your story. For god sake, it's almost not worth even investing myself into stories anymore.

In an R-rated film, where I have a reasonable expectation that children are *not*, then the same noise level as in the G-rated film would become much more annoying to me. In any case, yes, the occasional very low whisper in any film is fine, but when I walk into a Disney flick, I expect the noise level to be higher than when I'm walking into a Tarantino flick. I think someone expecting the kind of quiet from an older audience film when they're in a film targeted at kids is in for disappointment and kind of being irrational to boot.

Having a dual core CPU means that you can run the OS graphic services on one CPU and the browser rendering on the other, so even common tasks like browsing will be faster because the phone will not need to contex-switch continually. The graphic seem to be much faster, so existing games will run more smoothly and game makers will try to use all that power (old phones will use lower quality settings). Faster internet connection will be very noticeable. The increased storage size from 32 GB to 64 GB don't need software adjustments. HD video is good and you can upload to youtube inmmediately without waiting for apps. It seems a good hardware upgrade to me. Apparently people can spend money in Samsung Galaxy S II and they are cool, but if they spend money in a new iPhone upgrade they are stupid...

It seems as though the citizens of the US, and yes I am one, just want to bitch and complain about all of their problems. These same citizens and the groups which they have created to represent themselves don't even attempt to present solutions. I don't know how many times I've heard politicians on both sides of the aisle talk about how screwed up some law or bill is without ever clearly explaining their opposition and without even having thought of possible solutions to those problems. And then their constituents, the American public, just blindly reply with these crap talking points, issued by the leaders of the political party with which they are affiliated and to an even larger extent the corporations which back those parties, without even having thought about the problem or issue that they are babbling on about. I firmly believe that the problem with the American government doesn't stem from a problem with the system of government its' self, but from a much deeper fundamental flaw in the way the people are presented, by their government, with these blindly followed talking points which are just regurgitated over and over by the media and those within it who talk an awful lot, yet seemingly have absolutely nothing of importance to say.

1	If I lose, it's because the other person is cheating or the game is broken.	ReplaceSelect	gaming	1	1	0	2011-05	1305512043	Well, the idea is that if you lose then you were playing the wrong way. In fact, this mentality can be brought over to pretty much any game... which, of course, can make **many people mad** and can easily lead to a **bad reputation** and result in **higher priced games** if Valve implemented this system. I'm sure you've read Sirlin so you understand what problems Valve system can create for essentially innocent people.

0	I appreciate your opinion and respect it, even as I look at both history and the status of places who's economic policy has enforced a minimum wage that allows people to be able to have enough income for work, and completely disagree with you.	johnhummel	politics	1	1	0	2011-06	1309443137	I think the people who are harmed most by the minimum wage are those that it's aimed to help. The people who would make less than minimum wage instead aren't employed and make nothing. They also aren't working so not gaining skills necessary to make them more valuable in the workplace. Increased labor costs for companies are passed down to consumers. Those who are earning enough can bear the burden of those increased costs. Those who aren't, and now can't even find a job, are hurt most by those increased costs.

Non-American Redditors, what are some aspects of the U.S. that you feel are better than your country. Honest question. For all the negativity the U.S. garners in regards to its overall culture, both social and political, the U.S. still leads the world in many important areas. R&amp;D expenditures Nobel Prize winners Universities 4th-most competitive economy (behind Switzerland, Sweden and Singapore) It's still pretty happening in the U.S., though it is certainly are on the cusp of some particularly slippery slopes. Regardless, I'm interested to here some of the more anecdotal aspects of the U.S. that non-Americans would prefer. For example, I know many Americans would prefer the drug policy of quite a few European countries.

Field data collected in 2004 indicates that these benefits have been eroded by increasing the use of pesticides aimed to control secondary pests. The combination of Bt-cotton seed and other forms of biological pest control may help farmers regain the economic and environmental benefits of previous years. Failure to find a solution, may lead to the discontinuation of the use of Bt-cotton seed in China and elsewhere. "" The indicated GM crop wasn't even aimed at increasing yields, it was aimed at reducing the need for pesticide directed at bollworms."

I'm sure many of you have all had this same conversation with your friends as I have. What if there was a massive Pokemon game in which you began your journey in Kanto then went on to Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh and now of course Unova and potentially beyond? This massive journey would include everything the previous generations contained and more such as a massive battle frontier and other expanded metagame aspects. At the beginning of each of your journeys through a new region your Pokemon could be automatically transferred to your PC only to be accessed once you have gone through all the regions and obtained your National Pokedex. I'm sure there is some type of story they could create that ties in all of the opposing Pokemon groups. An idea I had is that there could be some board of directors which would have all the leaders of the ""Team Rocket""-like groups for all the regions in which they are all working together towards some goal. Or it could be the complete opposite of that in which they are all coming in conflict with each other and you must help diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand. The possibilities are really endless as to what they could do. Although it'll probably never happen it would be awesome to share ideas we all have for this type of game. So, dream away!"

1	just make sure you don't get one with a pistol grip	TheHast	guns	2	2	0	2011-05	1306140440	CA Resident here, with some pistol choices. I've been deciding between a subcompact and fullsized/compact handgun in 9mm. If i'm set on a 9mm fullsize/compact, I'm pretty much set on a glock 19 (though an STI 9mm 1911 sounds sexy, but pricey). Of the subcompacts I'm torn between hk2000sk vs a G26. My logic is this: one of the benefits of a full size (mainly capacity) pistol are nullified by the 10rd cap in CA, so I might as well get something concealable, in case I move out to a place that issues CCWs. And for some reason, it feels dirty paying for neutered magazines. For the subcompacts, 10rd mags are pretty standard. Anybody want to weigh in? (Additionally, I've rented a 19 and found it very manageable. Is the 26 significantly harder to control?)

I live in S Fl, I've been living at my current place for about 8 months. The lady 2 doors down, a 52 year old, has always been on my case. This isn't a milf, the lady doesn't look bad either but she still looks 52 years old. So last night she comes over with a friend, and I have a friend over. The lady is a bit under the influence and she climbs on top of me and starts making out with me, eventually everyone left and I pulled it out and had her give me some head. Btw, she was horrible, at everything. From kissing to giving head, she wouldn't put it in her mouth cause she said her mouth wasn't big enough she smelled of cigarettes. Eventually, she said she had to go home and that was the end of the story. Now, I wake up and I feel disgusted. Idk how to get it off my mind and now I have to put up with this lady as my neighbor still. I was part impulsed by my friend egging me on about it and partly because I was in the moment. I do find some parts of this story funny, but mostly it disgusts me. The lady constantly kept asking me questions, because she said she's writing a book about older women with younger men, and she felt as though she was teasing me the whole time (like I was uncontrollably lustful for her).

1	He sounds like fun...	piggless	sex	1	1	0	2011-02	1298503469	"He's disgusted by my fluid, and it's wrecked my self-esteem. Help. My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost three months now. Due to medical issues, we weren't able to have penetrative sex until recently. Instead, we had a *lot* of fingering, handjobs, and blowjobs. We were both highly inexperienced virgins. Although we're not prudes, I'd caught on that I was *by far* the more freaky one, and almost *always* the initiator of sex (of any kind). After a month and a half or so of sexual activity (and maybe a week of actual sex), he'd still never given me oral sex. He went down there, once, but took one look at me and then came back up. He tried to play it off, for what it's worth, but the message was clear. I tried giving him more frequent oral, hoping he'd feel like reciprocating. Nothing. I hinted that I wanted him to go down there. Nothing. I outright said (not commanding, but still fairly seriously) that I wanted him to go down there. Nothing. I finally decided, grudgingly, that I'd have to table my fantasy on the list of Things My Boyfriend Won't Do, Even For Me. Fast forward to last night. After watching a movie, I was feeling a bit riled up. We start making out. We get naked. I get on top of him and tease him a little, rubbing myself against him (which, he'd told me long ago, was a major turn-on). I stroke him for a bit. He doesn't touch me once between my legs. Finally I roll off him so he can get the condom (his insistence on the using condoms bit). He reaches down and feels around his dick- in my teasing, I've left a small wet spot on his lower abdomen. By the time he gets the condom out of the wrapper, he's gone soft. He tries stroking himself back up, but it's no use. After I clean up (i.e. throw away the condom for him, turn out the light, etc.) he tells me, quietly, that he has an aversion for sticky fluids. He can't handle ""when someone opens their mouth and there's a string of saliva"". He tells me that ""[he] tried going down on me once and [he] couldn't handle it"". And when he reached down and felt that wet spot, he just lost it. He says that even things in *movies* freak him out. I didn't know what to think. He'd never said anything about it before, although I had been wondering why, after he finishes when we have sex, he gives it maybe ten seconds before stripping the condom and holding it out to me for a tissue as if it's made of a deadly virus. I had a hard time this morning. In the bathroom, I didn't even want him to look at me. He tried hugging me, asking what was wrong, telling me that I could talk to him about it. I felt his morning wood against my leg and I couldn't look, at it or at him. I feel betrayed. I told him that, yeah, he just told me that he's disgusted by what happens when I get aroused. How would he feel if I told him that he disgusts me? He insists that, no, I don't disgust him, but I can't help but feel otherwise. If I don't disgust him, then why does it feel like pulling teeth to get him to touch me? Why does it feel like he believes my vagina is full of poison? Trust me - I've tasted myself before. I don't smell or taste like dying fish. I'm not sure what to do for him, if anything. He knows I'm hurting over this, but says that this 'aversion' (which I called an outright phobia) has been a lifelong thing. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of fear? Please, sexxit. I'm lost. **TL;DR: Boyfriend is disgusted by anything and everything that has to do with vaginal fluid and/or saliva. He still loves me, and still loves having sex, but even feeling fluid makes him go soft.**"

Sure it's linear, but most Final Fantasys were just as linear while only giving you the illusion of an open world. In previous Final Fantasy games, you had only one task on your plate at a time and most areas were blocked off until you had access to a Chocobo or Airship. The only difference was that older Final Fantasys had more oblong shaped hallways compared to FF XIII. So I say to hell will the generation of people that want Square to remake FF VII on an annual basis for the rest of eternity, I am still having fun with what they put out.

So he could go back to school afterwards and get his associate's in accounting. What's the point of college and the pressure to acquire a house mortgage of debt before you have your first job? Sure, there's a set of things you learn in college that we all say, ""Well, everyone should know this. Every good gentleman should be able to discuss Hemingway, aggregate demand, feminist theory, and Jungian archetypes."" But that always struck me as admitting that college is just a finishing school, there to give you the polish to prove you're from the ""educated class"". Then people tell me, ""Oh, but college teaches you how to think, to research, and to analyze."" But then I think to the idiots who've graduated college who never learned any of that effectively. To the students who see papers as empty pages to bullshit on.

It's a very simplistic take but I've yet to hear a clear and legitimate response for it; I have a question that I think is very simple but I've yet to hear a valid response for. I'd love to hear even a 'devil's advocate' argument on this because I just want to understand the other side and simply can't. Question. Why is ok to ask the American middle, lower and poor classes to make sacrifices so that we can get our budget under control yet it is considered by many to be damaging to our country to ask the same of the rich? Commentary. Apparently it is considered perfectly acceptable to ask the poor and middle class to sacrifice for the country's sake by gutting social security and so-called ""entitlement programs"" yet when the rich are also asked to make sacrifices by way of tax increases (and they aren't even tax increases, they would simply be repealing tax breaks and closing obvious exploitation of loopholes) many people act as if the government is out of control. I simply don't understand this. Personally, I think the tax cuts should not only be removed, I think we should then increase taxes on anyone making more than a million dollars a year by 10% and anyone making more than a billion dollars a year by 30%. I don't think the middle class and the poor share any of the responsibility for our current situation and asking them to sacrifice is ludicrous. The American public did not want these wars. They didn't exploit the banking and mortgage disaster. Further more, it is not the rich that create jobs in this country. It is the rich that control the jobs in this country but it is the masses, the majority, the middle to poor classes, that create jobs. Every time someone buys something they create a job for multiple people. The rich are parasites that are slowly killing our country by, with increasing effectiveness, leaching the hard earned money of the american public and then instead of reinvesting it, spending it on themselves or their own wealth. It's shocking to me that it is even a debate that the rich should make sacrifices."

Self esteem is not an issue for me, but I find a good self esteem has a reverse effect sometimes. It makes you perfectly content and comfortable with being an entity with no value. Worthless or priceless doesn't matter to me. I sound a bit like a douche, I didn't woosh I totally get what you're saying and you're right.

I once had an IT job that featured a moron manager. He lived way out in the boonies, literally two hours away from the office, and an hour from anything like a town. He still did the 9-5 (8-6, actually, due to another dick boss setting the hours) but oh man did he cause problems. For starters, he ran a 'ring' of porn trading, *entirely within the office and entirely on the office email servers*. For us in IT, who knew of it, it was all fine and everything; boys will be boys, and frankly the shit they were passing around is the sort of porn you find on basic cable anyhow. But one day, I found out that he was fucking *archiving* these various porns *in his goddamned inbox*. Before then, I had on multiple occasions been forced to drive to his house to manually back up his offline files, because his dialup connection couldn't handle it. We in IT had assumed that as a manager, in charge of a team of field guys, he was just emailing a lot. Turns out, I drive multiple hours multiple times *to take multiple copies of his fucking softcore pornography collection and store it on our company servers.* Before I had a nice chat with him about it, he would be emailing the file of the week to everybody. His file of the week was actually just a Powerpoint file, *with every fucking picture he had stuck inside it*. All of them. From all the weeks. The pps was over 2 gigs. He mailed it, on average, three dozen times a day.

0	You sound like an awesome person and it's terrible you felt so bad that you tried to commit suicide.	PathogensQuest	AskReddit	0	0	0	2010-09	1284296541	"My middle school years (high school in Quebec is 5 years lumped together at the same school, so grades 7 + 8) were nightmarish. I essentially committed social suicide on day 1 of high school since I was enrolled in the ""enriched"" program, where the smart kids lived. I was short, chubby and friendly, which set me up for the worst 2 years possible. It really, really fucked me up. I attempted suicide twice before the end of grade 8. I wished/prayed/whatever'd for hours every night that I wouldn't wake up the next morning. My self-confidence was destroyed, I became a complete introvert and I failed to develop any meaningful friendships until after graduation. Even at my current age of 21, I find myself following the same routine before falling asleep (not to anywhere near the same extent, but the thoughts are still there) and I have serious trust issues. Before you freak out, I think my case is a tad extreme. I didn't have the necessarily social skills to even minutely deal with the ridicule/torment/etc (it was never physical, thankfully), since I began middle school with the ""everyone can be your friend!"" mentality bullshit they force-feed you throughout primary school. I had no issues making friends prior to high school; I was class valedictorian, I was the lead in two plays and everyone liked me. I had never experienced alienation nor rejection, which is why middle school completely wrecked me. In retrospect, the best thing I could have done was immerse myself in extracurricular activities/hobbies. I would recommend you do this with your daughter if things get worse (at her pace, obviously). I'm a guy so I'm on the other side of the gender perspective, but I think the core problems are the same regardless of sex. That way she can meet people outside of the latrine known as middle school and develop friendships based on common interests rather than social rank. Despite this, I think I turned out pretty well (completed Biochemistry degree from McGill last May, will be pursuing a masters in Neuroscience/Pharmacology and then hopefully med school), just keep reinforcing the positive parts of her life and try to get her involved in other activities. It's great she's involved with dance - is there maybe an individual hobby or method of self-expression she'd be interested in exploring? My sax got me through the rest of high school."

1	What are you, some sort of communist?	TheFoodScientist	reddit.com	1	1	0	2011-03	1300164104	Yes, my taxes are higher because I am funding healthcare, but if you're in the US you will have to allocate a chunk of your paycheck to health insurance anyway. The difference is, my socialized medicine doesn't give a crap about pre-existing conditions and will pay for whatever ails me. Also, it's accurate to say that the cost of having a baby for the parents is $50. The taxes themselves don't change, and they remain based on income rather than factors such as medical history or how pregnant you are. The taxes simply allow you to access the amount of healthcare you need. In some cases, people don't need very much healthcare, and in some cases people need some pretty intensive care. In effect, since I haven't used the hospital in the past year, I've paid for a portion of some people having a baby, or getting a cancer treatment, which I'm completely comfortable with and actually a bit proud of.

Every January the wage goes up according to how much inflation went up. In January of 2011 the minimum wage only went up 3 cents compared to the previous year. I know what a novel idea, provide a minimum wage that keeps up with inflation so people can still afford to buy things - what a concept.

But the planes belong to the airlines. It really shouldn't have anything to do with the TSA. The only parties concerned should be the airlines and the passengers. If you don't like the security procedures of airline A then go to airline B, who is less strict. If you like having you and all your fellow passengers patted down then stay with airline A. If a particular airline wants to enforce overly stringent security measures they should be free to do so. However, a mandate to undergo visual inspection of one's naked body or physical molestation by a complete stranger to board someone else's plane is not freedom.

Yes they taught law, philosophy and medicine, but it was also about the pursuit of wisdom and becoming a better human being. I will never make a pile of money from my masters degree. Yeah that kinda sucks. But in the process of earning it, I have learned so much about myself, the world around me and about life itself. Now having those tools my education provided, I can go learn so much more. I am in a much better place than I would have been without my education, even if my wallet has not seen as many gains. tl;dr Money isn't everything when it comes to education.

I was running a little faster than her and it was dark, and I had a better sense of direction, so I was able to make it through the hole in the fence. I heard her yelling at me because she couldn't find the hole. Eventually, I saw the two flashlights were kinda swarming towards her, so I booked it out of there in my car. I never saw her again.

(personal anecdote, original content) A few years ago my brother and I went to visit my father who, at the time, lived near London. We took the coach to Gatwick, and he picked us up from there. To help us carry our things, my father had brought along his partner's 11 year-old son. My brother had brought his desktop computer in a large box, and the poor lad volunteered to carry it for him. He held it to his chest with both hands and started towards the car. As he walked down the pavement, his trousers slowly started to fall down until they eventually settled around his ankles. Everyone in the coach station was laughing at him. I think it might have scarred him for life.

1	I would certainly work hard and be rich if it wasn't for the higher tax brackets.	hyperbad	politics	14	14	0	2011-05	1306726220	The only real problem with taxing the rich is that one could argue that at some point if the taxes are high enough, it will discourage people from trying to become any more rich, since the money that they gain from working slightly more hard is less than the happiness/utility that they lose from having less leisure time and spending more time at work (Also called marginal utility). Up until that point, we should feel free to tax away, since certainly those assumptions are false in a sadly overwhelming majority of cases. It seems that people who subscribe to a very right-wing ideology seem to think that everything trickles down and produces more jobs, which would indeed boost the economy if that were the case. Unfortunately, I would argue that it isn't, and more good is done for the economy by taking that extra money that the rich would bank and giving it to people without enough money who would then need to spend it and put it back into the economy.

So, most of welfare dollars actually go to the middle class bureaucrats. Then another sizable amount of what is left over goes to people that don't even need it. All they have to do is learn how to fill out the proper paper work. The government doesn't do a very thorough job of actually checking on the recipients to see if the need is actually justified and it does very little to help motivate those that can work to actually work.

Mutt and pine have to support every imap server out there and have no ability to send features back to those servers. Gmail can. I think the best you can hope for is a desktop client that fully supports Gmail, but doesn't apply Gmail functionality to other mail servers. At that point, why not just run Gmail in your browser?

1	Of course, God designed it so you would think that.	Tordek	til	1	1	0	2011-01	1295916384	I actually studied these bats in college. Basically, they go out at night to feed and since they have to not wake their victims up when they bite them, it's usually an all or nothing feat for the bats. Either they successfully get their fill of blood, or the animal kicks them off and sends them home with an empty stomach. At the end of the night the cave is full of bats with either empty stomachs or full ones and not many bats in between. The bats with the empty stomachs will go and beg for a little regurgitated blood from the others, who will one by one share some blood until the beggar bat has had enough to eat. Evolutionists have determined there are three simple criteria for this altruistic behavior to evolve: * There must be a low cost of giving aid (regurgitating a little of the night's score) * There must be a high benefit to receiving aid (starving v. getting fed) * There must be a method of cheater detection. (The bats will recognize when a bat that they have fed does not return the favor, this bat will then be excluded from future help). I've used this exact example to explain to creationists how altruistic behavior can be explained through evolution, it usually sets them on edge.

Seriously, who watches a video of the 9-11 attacks *while on an airplane*? You can't even leave your luggage by itself; THIS isn't going to set off alarm bells? In any case, all they did was ask the father and son a few questions and then let them get on their way. From a security standpoint, asking someone a few questions and being proven wrong is a lot better than letting an airplane full of people die. I feel like safety is a valid concern when you travel in a chair tens of thousands of feet above the ground moving at hundreds of miles an hour.

And all its ""defenders"" that are essentially asking it to be categorized with tinpot dictatorships and kleptocratic banana republics aren't really doing it any favors. If your cousin Dave has been hitting the bottle too hard, you get upset and intervene because he's part of your family and Dave can do better than that. If you see some hobo plastered on the street, you're, at best, just going to feel sorry for them and give them a few bucks and walk away. Same principle applies here. Israel isn't full of honor killings and children being burned by their families because someone accused them of witchcraft. It doesn't have a double digit illiteracy rate. There aren't malaria or AIDs epidemics and it's not functionally run by drug cartels. People in other developed countries judge Israel more harshly because Israel has less of an excuse to be fucked up, and because peer pressure from other democracies is more likely to actually achieve something. We think. If its defenders are trying to say that Israel is so fucked up it has no hope of getting its act together, well, that's an argument they might wanna make, I don't happen to agree with it."

0	The answer is so blatantly obvious.	Nixon74	AskReddit	2	2	0	2011-06	1307932540	Girlfriend got wasted, ruined friends party, friend hates me, need objective advice. Last weekend we were at a party at my buddy's girlfriend's place. My girlfriend has waaaay too much to drink and does the following: 1. Tries to have sex with my friends girl 2. Asks friend for permission to have sex with his girl 3. Never mentions ANY of this to me (twenty feet away playing beer pong at the time) I had to find out days later when my friend decided to speak to me again. 3. Pisses a girl off by saying she thought she was going to marry the girls boyfriend, a guy I never heard of before. They apparently dated for TWO WEEKS in high school. 4. pisses me off by leaving the apartment to have a cigarette with a different ex boyfriend I didn't know was there and chats with him for 20 minutes until I came out looking for her. 5. And finally, the coup de grace, she pukes all over a couch that belonged to my buddy's girl's dead mother and passes out, leaving me to take the heat for the whole thing and drag her screaming, crying, drunk ass back to the apartment. I was praying we wouldn't get arrested. Then she puked in the bed. I've a somewhat colorful past myself, but because of that I try to stay away from headcases and fuck ups. We have been dating for awhile and she has meltdowns semi-frequently, although this tops everything by a mile. What would you do, Reddit, if you were me?

1	Because the Social Sciences are on par with climatology.	Scott_Ogilvie	AskReddit	1	1	0	2011-04	1302787713	All of us have lived on the Earth since we were born, and that makes us experts on it. The same goes for you. No on has to have a degree in climatology to understand what's happening: it's enough to get stuck in a blizzard or a hail storm and pay attention. We're suspicious of experts who get their credentials from on high, who have incentives to minimize things that are obvious to everyone else. The climate extends infinitely in all directions around us. It seems impossible to get a handle on how it works. How could anyone conceptualize the activities of billion of interacting forces? The idea that you need a complete understanding of the climate to come to any conclusions about it just serves to silence people. By that reasoning, only the best-informed climatologists are entitled to decide whether to go to work in the morning. However informed we are, at every moment we all have to choose whether to continue what we've been doing or try something else. Perhaps instead we can start from our individual positions, looking at the things that are familiar to us. If there are general principles that govern climate, they should be visible from wherever we begin. In this view, a climatologist isn't necessarily more qualified to talk about the Earth than a janitor.

Language is non-uniform, and there are plenty of sayings which make little sense, or imply the opposite of their 'actual' meaning. Language is diverse and changes, that's what makes it strange and beautiful. Too chastise someone for the natural expression, just because you have some asinine hangup about it is immature, childish and makes you seem like a prick who gives out at the slightest thing, not allowing for any organic evolution or flow of language. Go read a book, at one time a lot of words and sayings were introduced to the English language. If narrow minded asshats like you had their way, they would never have been accepted, and English would be a less expressive, less beautiful language. Go do something which actually matters.

That night I asked her... I spent the next 10 months looking for a ring and we went to visit my Grandma. When my soon-to-be Mrs went to use the ladies room, Grandma looks at me and says ""So when are you going to ask her to marry you?"" I replied ""I've already done that. Now I need to get a ring."" Grandma walks over to her dresser and hands me an old sapphire ring surrounded by small diamonds and says ""No more excuses..."" So we got the ring adjusted for my wife and I tried to figure out how to give it to her as I had already asked. We had gone to a friends party the night before and Mrs. Olaf got a bit hammered so I got up early the next morning and cleared off the top shelf of the fridge and left the ring box opened as the only thing on the shelf. When she got up she went straight for the juice... and came out of the kitchen crying while wearing the ring. That night we went to another party and we decided to not say anything. She walks into the kitchen and a mutual friend sees the ring and starts yelling ""NOOOOOOOO..."" as his GF had been putting on the pressure. A good friend looks at me once he figures out why our other friend is freaking out and says quietly... "" you bastard."" They were all engaged within 6 months It's been 16.5 years so far."

That said, he wouldn't have had the chance for a public appeal because I wouldn't have to ask my friends if Call of Duty is appropriate for children. Still, that was well-worded and hilarious. Reward him with something, for real. Maybe a ""T for Teen"" game like Rock Band, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed or Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions. Something fun that won't insult his age. So, unfortunately, maybe not Spider-Man. (I used to hate on Sesame Street when I was in grade school because I felt it was ""for babies"". Only later did I realize the true awesomeness of muppets.)

Alanna	reddit.com	1	1	0	2010-05	1274400204	Keep in mind that the Catholic church is not a democratic body and doesn't especially respond to public criticism. They can enforce any rules they choose on whatever basis they choose. Wear a hat? Excommunicated. Eat Cheese? Excommunicated. It sounds ridiculous, but they have the right to do it. They get to choose what does and doesn't merit excommunication. They have no legal obligation to excommunicate pedophile priests, but what they do have an obligation to do is comply with law enforcement and, when the knowledge is available to the diocese, separate known priests from contact with children.

I will be graduating this year with a degree in computer science. I have a solid GPA and have a couple years of internship experience. So, I think I should be able to get a few different job offers.

I know I would eventually like a job in some sort of managerial role, but am not sure how to best go about doing that. Should I try for a job where I can work in a more business role right away and risk losing out on a few years of experience as a software engineer? Should I take a job with as a software engineer and then attempt to transition to a more business-like role? How important is getting a job with a big name company? If I get a job with Microsoft or Google, would I pretty much be set? Is considering smaller companies a good idea for a first job? I have worked really hard the past 4 years to get good grades and have solid internships. I just want to make sure that I do not waste that work by not getting the job that best sets up my career. Thanks for any good advice you guys might be able to lend this evening.

I think since the state is in a constant well state of imposing violence on others reactionary violence towards those members of the state who most support its violence may not be unjustified in certain cases.

1	It should have Modern Warfare in the title, or some sort of sports game with a new year in the title.	richdub	gaming	1	1	0	2011-10	1318355119	"So what do you think a $60 game should contain to justify it's full price? So, lately I see a lot of complaining about DLC and pre-order bonuses. More specifically, people complaining that developers taking things out that should be in the game and charging us extra for it. I've been gaming for 10 years now, and from what I've seen, games for the most part have gotten bigger and longer while remaining at more or less the same price. So the way I see it, the DLC/pre-order bonuses are indeed ""extras"" that add to the game. I have never played a game and felt that it was incomplete because I didn't get a piece of DLC or pre-order bonus. So with that said, I'm curious. What does a game need to have to make you satisfied to pay a full $60 for it, and not feel like anything was missing. let's get a standard formatted poll going, list a genre, and what you think needs to be in the game for you to be happy that you paid $60 for it. (Assuming it is a game you enjoyed) I'll start. Shooters (1st and 3rd person) * 10 + hour single player campaign * 12 + weapons * Competitive multiplayer with at least 4 game modes and 10 maps * Some form of co-op multiplayer, either campaign or horde. One or the other."

All he has to do is wake up one day and forget his anti-depressants, discover his wife cheated on him, get screwed in some legal action, lose a family member, or anything else that causes people to stop caring about their life, and you've got someone capable of causing something like this. It would have been horrible if he'd killed any of those people, but the truth is it's a tragedy that he was lead to that position in life and then died, too.

We had everything set so we didn't have to do shit during dinner time. 2) I don't understand this at all 3) You're really caught up on the fried egg thing? I crack the eggs, I mix them in a bowl with my fork (usually the same bowl that that the fried vegetables came in), then I put that on the grill. You want to ask me about the eggs that get stuck to the bottom of the bowl because they get cooked in the dishwasher because our dishwasher doesn't wash them properly. You want to ask about the perfectly oval eggs that I take time to choose so I can spin them on my spatula when I do the egg tossing trick. 4) Weird, because I cook fried rice at home and it tastes pretty damn good. Maybe you just have a shitty recipe. 5) You're abso-fucking-lutely wrong about that. We cook a huge pot of rice in the rice cooker near the end of the night. Our kitchen helper then folds melted butter into and and it goes into the walk-in over night. 6) Check the description, I've linked a picture to my tools. 7) Cool story bro.

In fact, third wave feminism cropped up in no small part due to frustrations with racism within the mainstream feminist movement at the time, which seemed to be telling women of color, ""If you're not a middle-class white woman, shut up and wait your turn. We'll get to your problems once the middle-class white women are equal to middle-class white men."" That doesn't mean it's bad to call yourself a feminist because those people exist, though. If you don't like what they have to say, you can say that without having to disown the whole of feminism. If all the moderates were to abandon feminism, they'd effectively be ceding a historic, effective, empowering and diverse movement to radicals and sexists. I'm a Democrat. I don't agree with everything done by Democrats. I don't care for various liberal/progressive authors' opinions. I'm not especially fond of Al Gore, for starters. I voted for one Republican, one Libertarian and one Green last year, with the rest of my ticket being all Democrat (except for a couple non-partisan local appointments like judges). But I'm still a Democrat, and a very active one at that. Not that you have to call yourself a feminist to be ""good people"" in my book. But if you believe in gender equality, I personally consider you a feminist ally, whether you self-identify as a feminist yourself or not."

Not to mention that a dollar has a decreasing marginal utility. Giving a dollar to a millionaire is not the same as giving a dollar to a middle class person. The middle class person will spend that dollar on goods and services, whereas the millionaire is most likely to invest it in financial markets. Markets are great, but they don't create jobs in the same way that demand does. I suggest reading someone other than Friedman. He was wrong. And pretty much everyone except for conservatives now realize that Friedman's economic model was fundamentally flawed. Paul Krugman won a Nobel Prize too and he doesn't believe in trickle down economics, so I guess that negates your appeal to authority.

Digg4Died	funny	1	1	0	2011-01	1295504290	My Last Trip to Costco (emailed to me by my uncle) Yesterday I was at my local COSTCO buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my dog, Casper, and was in the check-out line when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think I had an elephant? So since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care, because the dog food poisoned me . I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff a poodle's ass and a car hit me. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. Costco won't let me shop there anymore.

Nobody on this site ever talks about the negative impacts of raising taxes on the successful are. Nobody considers the behavioral changes and how fucking up the incentive system undoubtedly has negative long term impacts. To understand why the rich are getting richer and the middle class is stagnating, you need to understand value based on scarcity of skills. Lebron James is paid millions of dollars because there are few or no equivalent alternatives to Lebron James. I face-roll every time someone on this site tries to make an argument that a CEO doesn't deserve 100x the salary because he doesn't work 100x as much as the receptionist. Republicans are about preserving the incentive system. They stand for something much greater than just ""protecting the wealthy"".

I mean, I know my iPad is more powerful than the first COUPLE generations of consoles. Why aren't they importing libraries of games for smartphones and tablets now? They won't all work that well because the lack of controllers, but I keep thinking about playing stuff like Final Fantasy VI on my iPad when I'm bored, and I can't think for the life of me why the hell they don't do that. Or at least make some old school RPGs, stuff with point and click, menu selection. That can't be that hard to program for the iPad. The only real game I bought for the iPad is Infinity Blade, which would probably be better on the iPhone or Touch, since you have to swipe your finger so much on it and its designed to use your thumbs on corner 'buttons'. I don't get it. The iPad app store is full of crap little games for people who liked Farmville, and very little that interests me, a pretty hardcore gamer. I also think the demographics overlap between iPad owners and hardcore gamers. This casual gaming crap annoys the hell out of me. I paid hundreds of dollars for an advanced tablet computer, and the only game I play frequently on it is freaking SCRABBLE. The hell?

Here's my logic: There are seven types of damage in WoW: Physical, Shadow, Frost, Fire, Nature, Air, Holy. There have been four flavors of WoW that have come out, each corresponding to one of these damage types: Vanilla (Physical, for the physical world of Azeroth), BC (Shadow, because of the heavy demonic presence in Outlands), WotLK (Frost, because dur, it's the Lich King), and Cataclysm (Fire, because from what I understand it plays a heavy part in the expansion). This leaves three damage types left: Nature, Air, and Unholy. We also have 15 levels left until 100, and it looks like Blizzard is doing a trend toward 5-level increments on new expansions. I remember reading an article quite some time ago stating that Blizzard wanted to eventually run WoW up to 100 levels. For Nature: Emerald Dream. For Air: Maelstrom. For Holy: Fight Sargeras. Sargeras is the Satan of WoW, and they've pretty much indicated that he'll be the final ""real"" boss. Sargeras was one of the original titans until he was turned to the dark side. I could also see the space-titans coming back to unmake Azeroth because it had become so corrupt, and having to fight the very gods themselves. Anyway, that's my 2c."

You drink wines you could never afford and when that one customer per night tells you that you're fantastic and that their dinner was win, it's a very nice feeling. I often find myself blushing (a rarity). As far as income, I find I'm pulling in about $50,000 - $60,000 annually, including tips. A decent living for four to five nights a week.

She's rightfully upset about Islamic people who enter foreign countries and then attempt to impose their religious laws on others, but for some reason she can't see that our military efforts don't really prevent this. What inspired me to post this, was her reaction to Reservoir Dogs, especially the torture scene (it scares me that she can't see the hypocrisy). She was freaked out by the excessive violence and casual disregard for human life. Any good documentaries or reports that might do the trick?

1	Yes, repatriate all Christians to America at government expense	wanderingmind	india	1	1	0	2011-07	1311157514	"Barkha Dutt upto her old tricks again. Obviously the Quran is foreign. Obviously the Bible is foreign. They way they came to this country is through bloody war. And the Hindus are expected to forget the legacy and baggage of these contentious religions? The Gita is a philosophical text within the Mahabharata which draws inspiration from the most respected shruti texts. We can't teach our children that but we CAN TEACH our children the story of an incestuous madman(Hamlet) in a play where everyone dies with absolutely no discernible moral content. But we CAN teach our children how Caesar was murdered in cold blood. But we CAN teach our children the story of a despot who murders with impunity(Richard 3). We CAN teach our children a heavily colonial play which talks about the natives of other countries in disparaging ways(Tempest). The major issue of disrespect towards our cultural heritage is over shadowed by these sickular warriors out to whitewash the past of our antagonizers WHILE such nonsense still maligns the textbooks of the children of this country. I think his greater point is referring to the Saudi and other Gulf sources which fund Madarssas and other Islamic institutions, especially in Kerela. I think he is also pointing out the HUGE inflow of money for the Christian organizations out to harvest the souls of the tribals and saps. In fact a recent article raised alarm that the missionary organizations have been the largest recipients of overseas donations in the last fiscal year(and have been for some time now). The billions of dollars flow into the conversion machines TO PROP UP FOREIGN IDEOLOGIES BACKED BY FOREIGNERS. Hence he makes a very valid point that the ""outsiders"" should shut the fuck up and get the fuck out."

She works the night shift at the Tim Hortons near Kipling Station in Toronto, last year a man bought a cookie in the drive-through but told her to give the cookie to the car behind him. The car behind pulled up and she told him, ""The car in front of you bought one of charity smile cookies for you."" The guy was so impressed he did the same. The car behind that guy did as well. The cookie car chain continued until 173 cars had gone through and bought cookies for the cars behind them in the middle of the night. One of her regular customers also had a story about what this week means to him. When he found out about how the money from the Cookies in my sister's store goes to Sick Kids' Hospital, he told her how it had a special meaning for him because when he was a boy growing up in Nova Scotia he contracted double-pneumonia. The doctors had given him about 24 hours to live, but a specialist from Sick Kids Hospital flew in and removed one of his ribs and inserted a tube that drained his lungs, and also performed two other operations on him. This was in 1936. He survived, and told my sister this story at the spritely age of 93. If you're picking up a coffee this week, spring for a cookie, and if you don't want it, pass it along!"

A few hours before, we'd stopped at a local eatery and, feeling frisky, I decided to try a new item on their menu. As I waited in the tux store for his fitting to conclude, I felt a slight rumble in the tummy but as an experienced poop-manager (I have mild IBS), I figured I had about an hour before I would need to start worrying. 15 minutes later, I revised my estimate -- disaster was imminent. As the cashier fiddle-farted around with ringing us up, my fiance finally noticed I was pale, sweating and whimpering and he asked what the problem was. I told him I was going to go to the bathrooms in the food court and would meet him there. I did the butt-clenched fastwalk through the store, down the loooooong hall, into the food court, and just as I hit the door to the bathroom, I lost it. I duck-walked into the nearest stall and surveyed the damage: underwear were a complete loss (but thank god I'd actually worn them that day!), shit all over the waistband of my jeans, shit running down my legs into my socks...and shit had soaked up into the tail of my white t-shirt. I was boned. My fiance kept texting me to see if I was OK and I finally told him to just wait for me in the car. He kept bugging me, wanting to know what was going on, and I finally texted back: ""I SHIT MYSELF OK? HAPPY NOW?"" His reply: ""Oh. Bummer."" There was little I could do to repair the damage. I tossed the panties and socks in the trash, braced myself, and ran out the restrooms, through the foodcourt, and outside to the parking lot...where my fiance was waiting with the car, passenger door open, seat lined with newspapers. On the way home, he serenaded me with 'Everybody Sharts' (to the tune of 'Everybody Hurts' by REM). Married 4 years...because if they love you even after you've crapped yourself, it's real."

The business side of healthcare has a huge influence on quality of care for patients. If business people make a bad decision (expanding into the wrong areas, investing incorrectly, pissing off physicians, etc.) it can have a major impact on patient care. Another part of this is how well business people encourage teamwork between different levels of an organization. If the business side is not ensuring engineering and infection control are working together, you suddenly have an isolation room that doesn't isolate properly. You'd be amazed at how often a lack of departmental cooperation causes adverse patient outcomes and how often it could have been prevented if organization leaders had stepped in earlier. So, there are cases where business people, with the best of intentions, can make a bad decision that majorly affects quality of life for people.

They were going to buy one of my HS's offensive linemen a BMW after they heard he was getting a ride from a friend while his truck was in the shop. Told him he would get anything he wanted for free. They found out he knocked up his girlfriend less than a day after she found out herself, and told him they would pay for the abortion and nobody would ever know. Thankfully, he was one classy motherfucker for being a lower-middle class kid from the sticks, told them that that was his baby and he would do what he needed to do. He dropped out of high school to work full time to support his family. They wanted him badly and would do or say anything to get him. Heard from some of the staff at Clemson that they were offered payouts by some alumni to sideline one of their players so the alumni's relative would get the starting spot in the USC-Clemson game. I was a trainer/manager for 2 years in high school if you were wondering how I heard about this stuff. Also, I would like to take a moment and thank your school for making my decision to purchase Georgia Tech season tickets completely worthwhile.

1	Helmets on a motorcycle are there just so they can find your head after you crash.	Clegko	pics	1	1	0	2011-08	1313936502	You may be able to find a metal helmet, especially if you look at motorcycle helmets and stuff. However, the good thing about plastic and foam is that it will deform and break. This will increase the amount of time in which whatever is hitting you acts, and will therefore decrease the amount of damage done to you, rather than just transferring the force directly to the skull, as a purely metal helmet would. It will still protect you, and possibly done a better job, in the process of breaking. Also, when I was looking around at motorcycle helmets it seemed that they have the additional problem of decapitation, though whether that's partly due to their higher speed rather than helmet design I couldn't say.

This is something we put in our parenting toolbox really early on. Telling them wild stories has turned them into great critical thinkers. My husband is much better at the bullshit than I am, but I've been known to pull it off really well from time to time. The stories have to be a way to explain something, they have to be wildly illogical, magical, or otherwise impossible, and I have to deliver them with complete sincerity and conviction. I love watching my son's face as he's listening, then I can see him processing the information. Then the inevitable barrage of ""why"" and ""how"" questions start. Eventually he will just laugh in my face and say ""Mom, you're just making that up. I think xyz happens because of this."" And then we learn about it together. He has an insatiable appetite for learning about the way the world works. The other day, we were sitting outside and the neighbor girl was showing us her loose tooth. I asked her what she was going to do with it when it fell out, and she told me about the tooth fairy. My son got the same look on his face, then asked all his questions, then freaking *laughed in her face* and announced that she was being silly. Sort of an embarrassing parenting moment, but it was nice to see that his bullshit detector isn't just tuned for me. I hope he didn't spoil her fun. :/ And we haven't even talked about God yet. We've talked a little about Jesus and what Easter is, and why Mormons won't let us in their ""castle"", but that's been necessary in our area."

Cost: 300/200 for ultra 300/150 3hydras Food: 6 ultra. 6 3hydras Damage: against normal/armor/building Ultra: 15/40/75 3hyrdas: 36/36/36 But the hydras shoot faster (.75 vs .861.) Meaning over a few seconds the hydras actually do MORE damage to armored than ultras (against buildings ultras still win) Health: ultra 450 vs 3hydras 240 (only category ultras win) Speed: same Since ultras are melee and have to move up, that pretty much guarantee one free shot from the enemy. ~20 marauders kill an ultra instantly. 3 Hydras do more damage to units, cost less, are ranged, and shoot air and ground for LESS than one ultra, which requires much higher tech. Ultras do splash, only thing making them close to worth it. Someone with good micro should not let them cleave though. Frenzy better be fucking awesome for me to ever bother getting them over hydras.

You're going to lose big time."" They laughed it up right up to the point when the election results came back. For fuck's sake, listen to the guy that has the under 25 demographic locked in, he probably knows what he's talking about. Seriously though, ""don't give them back the keys?"" Were they going for the middle aged soccer mom segment there? Quite simply, young voters are going going to go out and vote unless you interest them, and you're not going to interest them by telling them it's their fault, or by pulling out cheesy taglines, or even trying to explain dry political strategy. You interest them by getting right the fuck in their faces and yelling, ""HEY, YOU SEE ALL THIS SHIT THAT'S FUCKED UP? YOU LIKE IT BEING FUCKED UP? DO YOUR FRIENDS LIKE IT BEING FUCKED UP? VOTING BOOTH IS THAT WAY."" I will never understand how a large political party could go from a powerful message like ""Hope and Change"" to the joke of this election season. Or how you manage to take an issue like weed legalization, and not bother to market it to the right segments. Or perhaps how you take many hours if not days worth of clips of your opponents contradicting themselves, acting like total asses, and flat out lying, and not actually use that in any way shape or form. Here's a shocking bit of news, politics is a complex game. The Republicans are playing for keeps, while the Democrats are sitting on the sidelines listening to the coach tell them how they need to win.

1	lol go kill yourself.	Verroq	AskReddit	-2	-2	0	2010-03	1269677995	I'm a 19 year old college student going through some sort of quarter-life-crisis type thing, does anyone have advice? I am a 19 year old in college, and I feel like I am wasting my life away. I think one of the things which weighs down on my heavily on a day to day basis is the fact that I don't have, and have never had, a girlfriend. I know on a rational level that I shouldn't worry about it, and that I should just be myself and things will work out the way they are supposed to, but no matter how many times I tell myself this, there is still a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that something must be *wrong* with me or something I'm doing, whether that be body language, the way I dress or look, etc. I think that's the number one thing that bothers me, really. Of course, there are other things I haven't done in college that I'd like to do, like get drunk or go to parties, or just have new experiences in general, because I feel like this is probably the best opportunity in life that I will get to do those things, and spending my time in college sitting in my room listening to music and browsing the internet just seems like a terrible waste. I don't want to wake up one day and realize that I'm 45, I work in a dead end job, and I've lived a hideously boring existence devoid of meaning, but I feel like I'm headed straight down that path. I kind of know in a general sense what I would need to do to change this (get more involved on campus, get off the internet, reach out to people, work out at the gym, develop hobbies), but I seem to be having some serious trouble motivating myself to do, well, anything. Anyway, I just feel like I'm not the person I wanted to be when I got to college, and if anyone has any advice they can give to help me move forward, it would be appreciated.

It was falsely promoted as something that did, but in reality just ran a security audit in the background and reported back to the developer (shady). * The developer itself had removed the app from the market already. * Google removed the app from phones because not only was it falsely marketed (and then removed from the market altogether by the dev), it didn't do anything for the user (and didn't tell them about reporting security audits to home base), but the server it reported to was no longer running. It was literally just going to waste space and/or battery. Google was in the right here, and they sent notifications to the users involved, as well as telling the public exactly what/why they did it. I'd say that is 100% legit.

It's even worse when some of those people give you dirty looks for interrupting their conversation. This happens to me almost every day at work!
1	Commie!	Lurking_Grue	business	2	2	0	2010-01	1263498468	1. It is a world view issue mostly. There are many of us here who believe that such a huge disparity between ordinary average workers and high fliers is intrinsically wrong; morally, socially and economically. However we may also win ourselves the label of commie, pinko, liberal, hippy etc. Any society that has such an enormous disparity between the ruling elite and the ordinary folks is more than likely destined to have problems of the revolutionary variety when as the gap continually increases while the quality of life of Jo and Joanne Ordinary just gets worse. 2. I believe they were highly aware of the time bomb they were setting off by encouraging the sort of scale that the derivatives markets can reach when you start buying and selling debt that belongs to people who could never afford to pay it back in the first place. I believe there is a moral responsibility on banks to ensure that the type of products they produce benefit not just their own management but the economy as a whole. Their primary motivation is utterly selfish which runs counter to my own personal philosophy on life.

Knife chance that victim can fight back or get away. Gun will make people listen to what you got to say, and business can be done without a handshake. So people said if everyone got guns for protection than that kind of thing won't happen. Ok, How much crap we need to carry, you know how heavy the gun is to carry around? Than you have to worry about somebody steal your gun and do a bad deed, You can't get piss off at people because they also got guns and you don't know how crazy they're, you have to worry about somebody might shoot your ass if you look at them wrong. Yeah, I had to work in that kind of place for 3 year, doing work in middle of Oakland, CA, Streets of SF, South SF, EPA. There I work in place that damn near everybody got guns and it was no where safe!!! Just live with fear, but safe not my kind of living. Stop reading stupid crap NRA put out. Nobody is taking away guns, ban and restriction are put in places that have high crime. A lot of guns on the street are bought and sold in USA.
